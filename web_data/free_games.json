        "description": "THE OFFICIAL GAME OF THE FIA WORLD ENDURANCE CHAMPIONSHIP Le Mans Ultimate is the official game of the FIA World Endurance Championship and 24 Hours of Le Mans. Play-out the exciting new era for sportscar racing in unparalleled detail. Le Mans Ultimate offers an immersive game for both seasoned sim racers and those new to the sport and genre, growing and evolving with the real-life FIA WEC series.

Additionally, 3 LMGT3 cars from the 2024 and 2025 season (Mercedes AMG Evo, Ford Mustang and McLaren 720 Evo) have been added to the base game along with the incredible Adrian Newey designed Aston Martin Valkyrie AMR LMH with it’s ear-splitting V12. 17 cars are available in the base game with over 200 different livery variations. LASER-SCANNED LEGENDARY CIRCUITS Enjoy the pulsating challenge of racing around some of the most revered circuits in the world including the seven destinations on the 2023 FIA WEC calendar in the base game: Autodromo Nazionale Monza, Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, Sebring International Raceway, Bahrain International Circuit, Algarve International Circuit (Portimão), Fuji Speedway and the legendary – Circuit de la Sarthe in Le Mans – the playground for the ultimate racing experience. NOW AVAILABLE: 2024 SEASON CONTENT Get the latest content from the 2024 FIA WEC season - available as individual packs or as a bundle. These packs add 7 additional LMGT3 cars, 3 Hypercars and 4 incredible circuits - Imola, Interlagos, COTA (Circuit of the Americas), Qatar (Lusail International Circuit) INDUSTRY-LEADING PHYSICS MODEL Le Mans Ultimate uses the industry leading physics and handling simulation DNA from pMotor 2.5 as used and further improved from rFactor2 – enabling the game to take on more advanced simulation techniques, such as hybrid units, whilst also become more accessible and user friendly to the community – removing barriers to entry while also maintaining the key core elements of sim racing. Tyre dynamics are first-in-class, utilising an advanced “brush” model that accurately portrays slip angles and models advanced features such as vehicle “flat spots” that you can really feel. For wheel users, the 400Hz physics engine is directly translated into force feedback, delivering a highly detailed and predictable feeling to your steering wheel with presets available directly collaborated on with a number of prominent equipment manufacturers. The game also features improved in-game controller support as well as a selectable and customisable difficulty level – to allow the player to determine their own skill level with help for first timers allowing adjustable assists. DYNAMIC RACING EXPERIENCE Realistic day and night cycles are a key element of this simulation with incredible lighting effects as you race into dusk, through night and again into dawn down the Mulsanne at over 200mph. Le Mans Ultimate uses an advancement in Real Road 2.0 track evolution simulation found uniquely in Studio 397 titles. Like a real race session, the track will begin as a green, relatively gripless circuit at the start of a weekend and rubber in as more cars pass over the racing line – with cars moving the dust, dirt and marbles off-line. Work has been undertaken in several areas, including the dynamic weather effects too, such as rainfall and debris on windscreens and more realistic flow of water and formation of puddles on the circuit. The cars will also change throughout the race, and the build-up of dirt and debris will cover the car – giving it the authentic weathered, endurance look. MULTIPLAYER - COMPETE IN SKILL BASED EVENTS OR MANAGE YOUR OWN SERVER For those looking for the edge of the seat, wheel-to-wheel competition against real-life drivers, the Online function, powered by RaceControl, will be home to that pulsating challenge. Racers are able to take part in ranked Daily, Weekly and Special Events that provide the opportunity to build the player’s Driver and Safety rankings. As the player unlocks higher ranked races and exclusive events when the game develops and grows alongside the real-life FIA World Endurance Championship. Also available is player-controlled server hosting so users and leagues can configure their own experience, when they want it. For the latest information on all online multiplayer, head to RaceControl.GG ULTIMATE RACE WEEKEND Single Player fans can enjoy the Race Weekend feature which provides the perfect proving ground for racing against formidable AI opponents which customisable difficulty.

Players can also save their Race Weekend at pitstops, allowing you to complete your endurance races when it is convenient to you. PLAY TOGETHER: AROUND YOUR SCHEDULE [CO-OP MODE] An innovative co-operative mode has been added to the game, allowing you to race with your friends against the AI opponents at a time convenient to you. This “play by mail” style game mode, powered by RaceControl, allows you to invite your friends to complete a race, at a difficulty level of each individual user’s choosing whilst also racing for supremacy on the leaderboards as each action on track awards you points.",

        "description": "NEW FOR 2017: re-re-mastered more than a year later (mostly to fix bugs) but I also improved the graphics a lot, and added some more languages. Thanks everyone for all your support, have fun! ********** A small threesome of experimental games about male sexuality (Hurt Me Plenty, Succulent, and Stick Shift) about punishing, eating, and driving. These small short games attempt to expand eroticism in games beyond a cutscene and fade-to-black. What if sex in games was something we performed as players, instead of something we obtained? What might sex mechanics look like? How can we convey intimacy in games? That's what Radiator 2 tries to explore. GRAPHICS: This game certainly has a lot of them AVERAGE RUNTIME: 10-45 minutes total, it's up to you CONTROLS: Mouse or trackpad, most gamepads supported SUBTLETY: Not much Hurt Me Plenty: a short game where you spank the heck out of a dude and learn about how BDSM communities formalize consent / caring. Progress through negotiation, play, and aftercare, with your AI-controlled partner. Music by Liz Ryerson. Succulent: a short interactive music video game thing where you help a hunk enjoy a delicious shapely treat. It's pretty straightforward, really. (Now featuring new stunning immersive \"cheek physics\" technology!) Music is \"Waste\" by Arca, used with permission. Stick Shift: an autoerotic night-driving game about pleasuring a gay car. This game is a bit difficult and requires some finesse with timing, but it has a huge video tutorial and cosplay community, just search \"how to drive stick shift\" on YouTube. Music is \"Crybaby\" by Davey and the Chains, used with permission. ********** Q: I've played these games before. What's new? A: Hurt Me Plenty has been substantially re-designed. In general though, it's mostly improved shaders and HDR lighting with HD skin effects and hair physics. There's also gamepad support and text localization for several languages. Q: How much nudity is in this game? A: It is possible to witness some bare butts, and sometimes the characters are in their underwear, but otherwise there is no \"full frontal\" or anything. If this were a movie, it would be rated PG-13. Q: Will playing this game turn me gay? A: Yes.",

        "description": "Weird West legends meet eldritch horror in BLOOD WEST , an immersive stealth FPS. Become the Undead Gunslinger, doomed to roam the barren lands until he finds the means to purge their curse and free his soul. No, this isn’t your typical Wild West desperado redemption arc. This is a damnation arc. The Canyons, the Swamp, and the Mountains. Each swarming with abominable monsters and unholy demons, these are open-ended worlds for you to explore freely at your own pace. It will take the player over 20 hours on average to complete all three scenarios, and over 35 if they want to see everything the barren lands have to offer. Blood West is a stealth FPS inspired by the genre classics such as the Thief series (whose fans will be happy to hear the voice of Stephen Russell, the actor voicing the master-thief Garrett, returning here as the protagonist), S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, or - from the contemporary catalog - Hunt: Showdown. The gameplay rewards the careful approach: scouting the area, stalking your enemies, and striking from the shadows. Can you figure out a way to clear a fort full of ghouls and monsters without raising an alarm? The Barren Lands present the player with a nightmarish, twisted vision of the Wild West legends. The curse that has befallen the realm has corrupted every living thing, defiled the land itself, while summoning restless spirits and dark entities. In this mixture of gunslinger pulp and Lovecraftian horror, dark occult magick presents just as much of a threat as sudden lead poisoning. In Blood West you will meet many colorful, yet strangely twisted, fully-voiced NPCs. Just as much prisoners of the Barren Lands as you are, they will sometimes share their unusual stories and send you on various missions. Play nice and they might reward you or become your allies. Cross them and risk their wrath. The game won’t hold your hand. You’ll have to explore the land for yourself (buying a map from a vendor might prove useful!), and figure out your own way to approach quests. As you poke around the three expansive maps, keep an eye out for hidden places and secret stashes. There’s gold in the mountains! Fair warning - it’s probably cursed. If sneaking around isn’t exactly your thing, or you feel that you have a power advantage over your enemies, you can always take the head-on approach and meet your enemies guns blazing. Blood West comes from the creators of the fan-favorite boomer shooter POSTAL: Brain Damaged , so much gratuitous fantasy violence and pixelated blood splatter is to be expected! One man’s hell might be another hoarder’s paradise! From simple one-use items like bandages, through medical tinctures, explosives and incendiaries, straight to arcane artifacts that - once slotted - can change the way you play the game, the Barren Lands are just filled with STUFF. There are tons of useful items to discover, and there’s a special player’s stash crate for all those super-rare potions that you’ll hoard and never use. A gunslinger without a gun would be just a regular slinger. Where’s the fun in that? Blood West makes sure you’ll have plenty of weapons to choose from. Revolvers, rifles, shotguns, carabines - a great variety of firearms, from standard army-issue to those infused with powerful magic, or straight-up possessed. And if you prefer not to cause a ruckus, there’s a wide selection of hand-to-hand combat weapons and archery weapons to pick your favorites from. The RPG-like perk-based progression system in Blood West will allow you to highly customize the gameplay experience to your liking. Become a stealthy hunter, a revolver-fanning gunman or a relentless berserker. You will gain experience and progress through the skill tree, while discovering new artifacts in each of the scenarios that will bestow on you additional abilities. Combining skills and load-out creates more possible playstyles than you’d normally be able to explore in one playthrough. Are you ready to take back the frontier from the dark forces of demonic corruption and earn the right to move on to a better world? The Barren Lands call you, Gunslinger!",

        "description": "Early Access Note: Effulgence RPG is a sci-fi party RPG in a unique ASCII 3D style. This first Early Access build is a short, polished slice of the full game – roughly 1–1.5 hours for a first run, depending on how much you explore. You'll see the full visual identity, the ASCII globe, party combat and the core \"break enemies into particles and print gear\" loop in action, but with a limited set of locations and enemy types . Over Early Access I'll expand it toward a 3–5 hour campaign with more locations, encounters and tactical options. If you prefer a fully finished 1.0 experience, please add the game to your wishlist and check back at full release. If you'd like to play a compact, weird ASCII RPG already and help shape it, jump in now – your feedback will directly help shape the game. 🎧 Early Access bonus: everyone who picks up Effulgence RPG during Early Access gets the original soundtrack by Sergey Eybog as a free DLC. If the OST becomes paid later, early owners keep it forever. ░▒▓▒░ What the gaming press says about Effulgence RPG ░▒▓▒░ PC Gamer : \"Sure, the ASCII art is cool, but I'm pretty into what the game seems to be doing with its RPG mechanics, too.\" The Escapist : \"Effulgence RPG is an ASCII-based party RPG that has visuals that remind me of both Dwarf Fortress and Geometry Wars at the same time, except it's an RPG.\" Alpha Beta Gamer : \"Effulgence is an incredibly cool looking ASCII-styled 2D RPG adventure where players explore a mysterious alien world rendered entirely through text symbols.\" GamingOnLinux : \"It looks like nothing else I've seen before, it really is quite impressively made.\" ░▒▓▒░ Game overview ░▒▓▒░ Effulgence RPG is a party-based, turn-based RPG where enemies are more than obstacles - they're raw material . Defeat creatures to break them into particles, then feed those particles into a matter printer to create weapons, gadgets and mechanisms. All of this plays out in a world built from shimmering text symbols arranged in 3D space. ★ Explore a stylized ASCII 3D globe of locations. ★ Fight as a small squad in turn-based, party-focused combat . ★ Break enemies into particles and print gear mid-run . ★ Watch the world shift as text symbols reconfigure into new shapes and animations. ░▒▓▒░ Content scope ░▒▓▒░ At Early Access launch: ★ A compact, replayable slice showing the full gameplay loop. ★ Roughly 1–1.5 hours for a first complete run. ★ A focused set of combat locations and exploration spots. ★ Core systems implemented: party combat, particle crafting, matter printer, saves, basic settings and controller support. Toward 1.0: ★ More locations and mini-quests on the ASCII globe. ★ Additional enemy types and \"mechanisms\" (special encounters and bosses). ★ New tactical cartridges and more ways to build your party. ★ Expanded narrative interludes and quality-of-life improvements. ★ Overall target: a 3–5 hour campaign with room for experimentation and replay. ░▒▓▒░ What Effulgence RPG is (and isn't) ░▒▓▒░ Effulgence RPG is: ★ A short, visually intense party RPG built entirely from text symbols. ★ Focused on ASCII 3D visuals, atmosphere, and darkly comic dialogues . ★ Turn-based combat that is readable and punchy , not a hardcore 100-hour min-max grinder. ★ An art project about light and symbols as much as a game. Effulgence RPG isn't: ★ A huge open world or endless roguelite with hundreds of hours of content. ★ A hyper-complex tactical simulator with dozens of overlapping systems. ★ Completely content-complete at launch - this Early Access build is a vertical slice that will grow over time. ░▒▓▒░ Game features: ░▒▓▒░ ★ The only way to gather crafting resources is by defeating creatures and breaking them down into individual particles. ★ Using these particles, you can print weapons, gear, and mechanisms on a special matter printer – even in the middle of combat. ★ A stylized ASCII 3D globe of locations to travel between: combat zones, events, upgrade spots and shops. ★ \"Tactical cartridges\" that twist fights in your favor: area bursts, shields, special effects and more. ★ Designed to be short, focused and replayable - experiment with different party builds and printed gear. ★ Runs great with a controller and has been tested on Steam Deck via Proton, with ASCII readability tuned for a handheld screen. ░▒▓▒░ Plot ░▒▓▒░ It's easy to transmit a video signal when you're just the distance of a satellite away. Go beyond the solar system and it may take hours to send a regular image to Earth. But when the signal comes from a galaxy a million light-years away, only fragmented symbols make it to us. Sometimes, they can be decoded and assembled into an animation made from text characters. Effulgence RPG imagines what happens when that signal is interactive - when you can walk inside the shimmering sea of symbols, and the creatures made of text don't intend to stay static. ░▒▓▒░ Inspiration ░▒▓▒░ Characters that can be typed on a keyboard are a powerful means of expression. ASCII art uses characters as strokes, crafted like those of an artist's pen. Each stroke carries both form and meaning: a letter, a number, a symbol. The quality of modern printing, monitors, and phone screens is astonishing. Does ASCII art have a place in the era of True Color and ultra-high pixel densities? Absolutely. Charcoal has been used since cave paintings, yet charcoal drawing remains relevant to this day. Paintings with rich palettes haven't replaced black-and-white graphics. When an artist picks up a pencil, it becomes a tool for creation. When an ASCII artist pulls a keyboard closer, ASCII art is born. But what if we add a third dimension to these characters? And do so without breaking the feel of the text mode. Effulgence RPG is more than just a game - it's an artistic exploration of light and symbols in motion.",

        "description": "SURREALIDADE - DEFINITIVE EDITION Welcome to your mind! In the 20s, artists led by André Breton got together to create a new form of art, an art that used the expressions of the unconscious through the Psychic Automatism. To this end, they developed the Surrealist Techniques, which are nothing more than ways to bring out this dark side of the human mind. Today, you will follow in their footsteps, bravely exploring a strange and bizarre world, bringing to light the imagery and genius of the Surrealist movement. Be taken on a journey through Surrealist Techniques, and if you are chosen, you will reach your ultimate goal: The Macrocosm! Witness an inner universe and actively participate in this unusual saga, which may lead you in other directions. But do not think that this will be an easy task! You will experience an immersion in a virtual environment where you will have to interact freely with the objects and beings that live there. Your mission in search of the Supra-Reality will be arduous, you will have to follow the path that the Artists and Philosophers of the Surrealist Universe have trodden. Beware, you may arrive in places that are not so welcoming. It is up to you to discover the secrets of this exotic environment, and to do so you will have the help of the strange beings who may be willing to help you. There will be moments when your skills will be put to use, reasoning, intelligence, inspiration, agility, and a good sense of exploration are some of the ingredients that you must not fail to bring to venture into Surreality. Culture, Art, Entertainment, and Knowledge combine to form an authentic Surrealist experience in an inhospitable and unknown world called the Unconscious. WHAT IS SURREALITY Surreality is an obscure, totally independent Brazilian game created in 1999 by a small team of surrealism-obsessed people. Over the years it has become cult among its admirers. The version you are going to play now is the definitive edition, with a series of improvements and extra material for you to better enjoy everything Surreality has to offer, but the story, graphics, music and gameplay remain intact, exactly the same as it was created in 1999. We are very proud of this project that, although dated in many ways, maintains its charm and innovation to this day. It contains some elements that in today's eyes may sound offensive to some people, even though they were not created with this intention and do not represent the opinions of the team. In the name of historical preservation we have decided to keep these elements unchanged. What you are about to play is a love letter to surrealism and gaming. Enjoy, and open the doors of your unconscious. Dimitri Kozma GAME FEATURES Three levels of play! There are three levels of action, presented in sequence, allowing free choice of depth for the adventurer, where the degree of immersion in the world of Surrealism will be decided as he/she chooses: Real World - This is the first level, for those who dare not enter the mind. This world offers a wide range of material about Surrealism. Ideal for those who just want to do research. Human Mind - Conscious: You have already entered the human mind, now your perception regarding the world around you is slightly changed, explore as you wish. There are several environments that hold countless surprises for those who are brave.

Human Mind - Unconscious: Finally you reach the core of Surreality. The Unconscious holds countless surprises beyond what your eyes can see. Don't fool yourself, explore to the maximum, talk to everyone and try many possibilities, you won't be punished for trying, most of the time you will get another chance. There are many secrets in countless environments. If you are able, you will reach your final goal, the Macrocosm! Three Endings! Play several times!

        "description": "Bakemono is an anime themed VR mech action adventure. Shoot, Wallrun, and fly while having full control over both hands and weapons. The game’s campaign is centered around a battle for the Solar System, in which The United Mars Federation betrays the treaty of 4712 – NSE ( New Solar Era), initiate a terrorist attack on The Sky Dominion Corporation and The Terrestrial Royal Empire. The United Mars Federation has banded together with the current Raider Pirate Tribes and Rogue Military Factions to form an unstoppable force and wish to unseat The Terrestrial Royal Empire as the primary ruling body in the solar system and by proxy The Sky Dominion Corporation. Circumstances have forced The Terrestrial Royal Empire to use the original seven BTB Units: code-named “Bakemono Initiative”. These legendary mechs are the only weapons capable of defending the Earth. Not wanting a full-scale conflict or the destructive power of the seven original legendary BTB Units: to be unleashed that would drag all of humankind into another war. Sky Dominion Corporation hires the infamous “Arc Babies” of the Arc Space Union Colonies. Battle harden during the “Raider Route War” and infamous brutality of taking back Sigma Station from rogue Military Pirate Factions. Completely rebuilt game ( 3x's ) from player feedback and performance. New Menu, New Tutorial, New Calibration System, New Levels, New Enemy Pilots. Honestly I took for granted how many advanced features there are in the game, and how anyone but the most advanced VR players would intuitively understand some of the underlying control systems and movement tricks available in the game. The majority of the feedback from the players was that the tutorial was too hard. I redesigned it many times and made over 30 illustrated cards and added them to the brand new tutorial Fight in large open areas with multiple avenues of approach to the objectives. Land, Sea, Air, Urban, and Zero G environments are available for hardcore pilots to traverse and master. Levels were rebuilt to accommodate the wall runs which will later be added to the combo and scoring system itself similar to rails in THPS.",

        "description": "Defeat an AI in this co-op party game! Deviation Game is a co-op party game for 2-6 players that pits human creativity against AI perception. Your goal: draw secret prompts like \"Flamingo\" in a way humans can understand, but an image recognition AI can't! Up to 6 people can play with one copy If just one person owns the Steam game, everyone can join by watching that player’s screen. Up to 6 players can join for free using their smartphones’ web browsers via a QR code. How to play 1. Join using your own device Using your mobile device, scan the QR or enter the room code at outdraw.ai to transform your device into the game’s controller! 2. The drawer picks a prompt The drawer first picks a secret prompt from categories such as objects, actions or even concepts. 3. Time to deviate! Then they just gotta draw it! But remember, the aim is to trick the AI while making sure your friends still get the picture! 4. Everyone (plus the AI) guesses Once the drawer is done, all the guessers will submit their best guess, including the AI! Choose carefully, you only get one chance! 5. The answer is revealed! If you fail to fool and the AI guesses right, then humans lose! If the AI fails and humans guess right, then humans win! AI to enhance (not replace) creativity By embracing the medium of games, Deviation Game aims to use AI as a collaborative tool that seeks not to replace human creativity but to enhance it. Through the game, players learn to express themselves in new ways to deviate from what the AI has already learned, making for a fun and brain-teasing party experience, where you’ll create things no one has ever seen before! Flipping Alan Turing’s revolutionary 1950 Imitation Game on its head, Deviation Game encourages players to fool the AI instead of the AI trying to fool them. Keeping consent clear At the end of each game, players can consent to their drawing being used to potentially train the AI... or not! Allowing you to decide how the game may evolve. Collection is opt-out by default, and all data without consent will be deleted. By working together, players from around the world can collectively uncover the biases in large AI models by exposing their blind spots in interpreting diverse, culturally specific drawings. Played by humans around the world Deviation Game was initially showcased as an art installation at Civic Creative Base Tokyo in 2023. The work has since been shown in globally renowned exhibitions, such as Ars Electronica, Taipei Digital Art Festival, and Now Play This, engaging audiences of all ages and sparking critical discussions around AI and creativity. About the creators Deviation Game was developed and self-published by a group of good friends consisting mainly of game designer Tomo Kihara and art-design duo Playfool (Daniel Coppen & Saki Maruyama). With a focus on play, their practice centres around designing tools that foster creativity and making artistic interventions that engage with urban space and society. Their previous work How (not) to get hit by a self-driving car received an Honorary Mention in the S+T+ARTS Prize 2024 at Ars Electronica. Deviation Game is their first experience to self-publish an indie game. FAQ Q. How exactly does the AI guess? A: In each round, the AI will return numerous guesses, depending on the number of players in the game. If one of those answers are correct, AI wins! Q: Doesn’t the AI just have access to all the prompt words? Surely it’s cheating! A: Not at all! While some examples are provided to the AI to give it more context, it is freely guessing each answer it submits, which is why sometimes they’re a little off-base. Q: What AI model are you using? A: Throughout Early Access, we are experimenting with various AI models via the service OpenRouter. In the future, we plan to introduce a feature that allows players to choose which AI model to go up against. Q: Does the game’s AI get smarter after each game? A: No, the AI is not learning in real-time. However, custom improvements to the AI can be made with a future update after enough data has been collected to retrain the model. Q: How is our drawing data being collected? A: We only collect drawing data that has been given explicit consent. Collection is opt-out by default, and all data without consent will be deleted.

Soccer Online Playing single-player vs bots is so fun, but this is a modern esport game. Play online in the cross-platform multiplayer and play with other humans over the internet (or local network). Exciting and addictive Co-Op/PvP is the strongest element of this indie game. More than soccer Ball 3D has other sports for you to enjoy on-line: Basketball, Handball, Ice Hockey, Racing, Battle Royale and more. In Battle Royale survival is the key. Carefully overwatch the entire battlefield and avoid your opponents at all cost. It is not a shooter, there is no crosshair, the only weapon you have is you). You win this combat only when all your rivals are \"dead\". Use your reflex to win this epic war. The racing mode is like a kart racer, but with discs. During the race you drive using your mouse and keyboard as a controller. In Hockey mode you play with a puck.

Unlike many RPG games where you level up your character, here your quest is to improve yourself. Whether you prefer golf, tennis, pool, baseball, cricket, volleyball or any other olympic sport, you will still like Ball 3D. Teams Building your own team is half of the success. Choose a name/tag (FC The Best, AS Best Players, EAS-Vampires, Foot Monsters (FM), Greatest Among Many (GAM), FRE or any other) then invite your friends to join the party and become a real team coach/manager.

If you lose, challenge your opponents to a rematch. Invite 1, 2 or 5 friends, 6, 7, 10. Not enough? How about 25, 26 or even more. Cooperation is the secret formula. Your team is hollow without it. Try to play positional attacks or it may defend the goal like a tank, lock the penalty area, turn it into a fortress and try counter attacks. Parking a bus in the goal is a sensible tactic too. Picking the best tactic for your team is like solving a puzzle, use your head and logic. Stealing tactics from your opponents is not theft. It is your role to decide if you want to play with one striker or with two, with three defenders or with four. You may try accurate short passes to gain space or full power flat strikes. Try all possible ideas and alternatives or your team will fall. Welcome new players! Simple tutorial will teach you how to play. It will help you massively to improve during the humble beginnings of your career. It is like a sandbox that lets you practice your moves and tricks. Multiplayer The game offers very advanced and optimized network code, including client side prediction anti-lag system and great dedicated servers in various regions that offer low ping. It is one of the most dynamic highest-rated coop soccer games. If you like multiplayer or mmo games you will love it. Ball 3D is mainly not a singleplayer offline PvE game, but you may decide that it is too early to play with real people and prefer to try your 1st game solo vs bots (AI). Man of the match The name of the best player will be featured and shown on the board as the man (woman) of the match. Put your name there and become popular! It tastes really wonderful to reach the apex and become the hero of the match. Replays Replays (demos) will help you craft your soccer skills into an art. Watch the matches from various cameras, including: TV, Action, Top Down, Auto and several others or from the 3rd person perspective. Remember to record replays and save your \"wow\" goals for later. Soccer variations Try modes like: Darts, Ping Pong and others. Ball 3D is a super fun, rich and deep co-operative game not similar to any other. Different environments Play on the grass, darker grass, dried grass, sand (desert), snow, concrete or rust-colored gravel. Play during the sunny summer, cold snowy winter, rainy autumn or green spring. Do you prefer the daylight or the dark night? Clean hot sky, clouds, wind or maybe a rain? Play on stadiums like: Classic, Real, Small, Big, Good, Mega, Huge, a street city stadium called Urban and many others.

This, added with the Welcome Pack that seems to have been around for a while, is being shared again. If you create an account for Stove, you get given a coupon voucher that you can apply to orders. New users currently get a 50% off coupon, and a $5 coupon. You can use both of these for orders (at the same time too). The welcome bonus is not new, but it's possible there have been changes with time. https://event.onstove.com/en/welcome https://i.imgur.com/suMRKXk.png Thanks to /u/Saulios for the image. Anyway, with this coupon you can claim a variety of games for free. /u/adamroadmusic put together this list , and /u/SteveLosive shared these , /u/mahadev-1 found Ghostrunner and /u/BeatTheMeatTwice shared that they got Detroit Become Human and Heavy Rain . So, stack up some coupon(s) and snag some stuff on Stove! Feel free to construct a list here if you wish, but please stop sharing single games individually with the coupon(s).

        "description": "RoboBall is a game in which you control a ball-shaped robot and solve physics- and logic-based puzzles. Your goal is to control various mechanisms in order to reach the end of the level, where you will find a teleporter that will take you to the next level. Puzzles On every stage you will find a large number of different mechanisms, buttons, laser switches, and doors. To open a door, start an elevator, or simply activate a certain mechanism, you will need to activate a button. Sometimes you can't do it by yourself and will need some help from metal balls, barrels, or crates. But don't forget that they might also need your help to perform certain actions. Workshop RoboBall has a level editor that is very flexible and packed with functionality. All of the levels in the game were created using this editor. Place static objects such as zones, paths, glass tubes, and metal tracks. Active objects perform various functions. These include doors, elevators, and machines that create metal balls, crates, or barrels. Buttons deserve special attention. You can use them to open or close doors, activate elevators, or deactivate turbines that are preventing you or any other physical object from advancing. There are two different kinds of buttons in the game: switches, which activate the objects they are linked to and then turn them off again when pressed a second time, and triggers, which activate objects as long as you or another physical object remains on top of them. When the object leaves the trigger, the objects linked to the button are deactivated. Once you've created a level you can publish it in the workshop. You can also play other players' levels.",

        "description": "The Seventh Republic—the city despised by the sun. Sunlight hasn't reached here since the last great war and the shadows teem with vicious criminals. With evil threatening on every side, the National Police Agency is a stronghold of justice. Detective Ruka Hiryu belongs to the 13th Division—nicknamed the Sideliners, and treated like shit by the rest of the force. Absent any major incidents to keep him distracted, Ruka has been investigating the sealed Cult Massacre case in secret, but things change when the 13th picks up two new members. The agency is shaken with unreliable rumors about the semi-mythical Shining Union, and as suspicions and conjecture fly like bullets, will Ruka, the 13th, and the NPA go unscathed? Features Superpowered detective noir visual novel Regular-powered buddy-cop banter Moody, jazzy soundtrack Characters A detective who's had a hard time taking his work seriously for the past ten years, ever since he lost his mentor in the Cult Massacre. One year ago, he was forced to partner up with the rookie cop Claris, and in the course of their investigations together he reencountered the A-class criminal known as Linda. Recently, he's been moving independently of Claris more often... His abilities are ice-based and too powerful for him to fully control. He keeps them repressed most of the time. An officer in Ikuta's 1st Division, strong-willed, but formal and restrained. She hates Ruka for being so familiar with Ikuta, despite the difference in their ranks and Ruka's station as a lowly sideliner. Although ordinarily a stickler for the rules, she dives headfirst into regulation-breaking when she suspects that her family may be involved in a case. The beautiful sole employee of the café Love & Peace. Ruka finds her very attractive. He is hardly the only one—half the police force seems to be after her. Given how many police officers she chats with in the course of her work, she is surprisingly well-informed about internal NPA affairs. A detective newly reassigned to the 13th Division. Originally associated with Forensics, she has all the necessary skills to do such work. However, she has serious problems forming human connections, mostly because she actively avoids other people. This hasn't changed since she joined the 13th, and she rarely converses with anyone aside from the usual morning and evening greetings. A fresh-faced rookie elf assigned to the 13th Division. After a year on the job, she has begun to develop a hint of competence. Unfortunately it's still just a hint at this stage, and she slips up in minor but important ways. She possesses the common power of elves, an ability to control the wind that excels in mobility and defense. The exiled princess of Genomland. Ruka saved her from pursuit by dangerous assassins. With the heat off her for the moment, she has been working at the NPA's cafeteria to make a living and enjoy the protection afforded by the agency's walls. A sweet and earnest girl by nature, she has both the older lunch ladies and the cafeteria's clientele wrapped neatly around her finger. An officer in the traffic division, Komachi is bright, witty, and a sucker for a handsome face. Her father is a senior police commissioner. She's a seasoned organizer and attender of weekend mixers, through which she has a wide web of personal connections. She ends up looking after Ruka with some frequency, if not always entirely voluntarily. The two once cooperated on an undercover investigation. A segitt swordswoman who leads a simple, rustic lifestyle compelled by her chronic lack of funds. Exceptionally strong even for a segitt, she's capable of facing down a delga one-on-one. She lives next door to Ruka, and runs a small subsistence farming operation in the hallway. She's also found steady employment with Strichoss's security outfit. Ruka's roommate, who dwells secretly in his coat pocket. Pixies like her are rare, and popular as household pets, which makes them targets for poachers. Ruka saved her after she fell into wicked hands. She's a busybody and won't keep out of Ruka's business, but her bright cheer easily compensates. When Ruka gets up to things she'd rather not see, she's considerate enough to go to sleep or simply pretend not to notice. An officer of the 13th Division, her information analysis and hacking skills are top-notch. She's so devastatingly effective, in fact, that she tends to look down on others without even thinking about it. Her partner on the force is the segitt Vars, and the two complement each other well. Due to the limited care she takes with her appearance, her eye-catchingly long hair is a bit of a mess. A dangerous Keeper with a power that allows her to control the young minds of children. More than ten years ago, she led a gang of child thieves called the Luiz, and it was in that capacity that she first crossed paths with a younger Ruka. Now, over a decade later, she still looks much the same as she did back then. She has been assisting Ruka with his hunt for the Cult, but her true motives are still a mystery. A keeper who wields powerful flames. This ability, combined with her investigative chops, has brought her to the considerable rank of Commissioner in a somewhat chauvinistic police agency. She's been following Ruka's activities with interest as he pursues the Cult from the shadows.",

        "description": "Every Flash game produced by Undefined Back in early 2008 as a solo indie developer, I started producing flash games under the name Undefined. Over the subsequent years until the death of flash player I published 22 different free-to-play games, many of which were highly popular. Mostly as an answer to requests but also as a vanity project, I'm happy to present the entire collection. If you remember any, it's most likely that it's one of the most popular game series, such as Protector or Legends of Arkandia, but, did you ever play the others? With the advent of Ruffle, a new open-source flash player, I'm now able to bring those old games back to life and provide a standalone version of them. Lots of work has gone into making sure each game runs at an acceptable level. There will be quirks, and sometimes things won't be exactly as they should be, but I have personally played every game in the pack and am happy with how they look and feel. The gameplay has been left mostly untouched, except where there were obvious bugs, which have been fixed. I hope you enjoy playing this classic little slice of my brain, I've enjoyed putting the pack together and remember fondly creating each and every one. Games in This Pack Protector Series This is where it all began. Back in 2008, tower defense was a simpler genre— Protector was my early attempt to mix tower defense with RPG depth. Over time, the series evolved, introducing faction rep, hero-specific units, equipment, skills, and even collectible Protectormons . Protector Protector II Protector III Protector IV Protector IV.V My Pet Protector Series Here, the focus shifts to a sim-life experience. You manage your hero’s life—balance work, school, and the occasional dungeon crawl as you shape their destiny. My Pet Protector My Pet Protector II My Pet Protector III Legends Series An evolution of the My Pet adventures, the Legends games refine the classic RPG formula with quirky, inventive gameplay. Expect unexpected twists that prove even old Flash games can break the mold. Arkandian Crusade Arkandian Revenant Arkandian Explorer Miscellaneous Gems These titles might not follow the series format, but they’re every bit as creative and fun. Each game has its own identity - a mix of experimental ideas, inventive mechanics. Whether you’re in the mood for bite-sized challenges or something off the beaten track, you’re in for a treat: Little Protectors – Mini Protector, 2d and includes several new ideas, some of which are good, some I hold my hands up and admit, not so good. Hordes of Hordes – Another tower defense game, but one with a bunch of new ideas compared to Protector gameplay, such as dynamic pathing and endless gameplay. Engage – A space strategy epic that spans 100s of levels. Cardian – A card-based twist on classic gameplay elements. Dead of Night – The very first Undefined game, it's still worth a few minutes of time. Condor Cowboys – No comment. Quick Quests – Heroic RPG goodness in 5-minute bursts. Token Hero – Grid-based gem matching, but with its own rules and some RPG gameplay to boot. This was the last game I produced and includes a fitting tribute to my old best friend. Elements of Arkandia – Puzzle quest, but with some Undefined magic and style. Little Protector Planes – Session-based gameplay, pre-popularity of session-based gameplay. Explore infinite planes and recover treasures and powers from each one. UO Defender - The prototype for Protecter, this small game was produced as a fan game for the game Ultima Online way back in 2006 before I really began producing games proper. Steam Deck Support I've tested each game on the Deck and the majority run very well, some work is still needed for some games to improve performance, but overall, the experience is great. If you're having problems with a specific game, sometimes switching to Proton Experimental can improve performance.",

Across all modes your ship is your home and lifeline for you and your prospector crew. Keep it topped up with ice, fuel and ammo so you're ready for anyone or anything the Reach throws at you. Blast your enemies with hi-tech cannons and gadgets, lure them into deadly traps, or even mess with their ship... as long as they don't sabotage yours first. When your perfect plan goes out the airlock, there's only one option... wing it! Stay one step ahead as you and your crew navigate the Reach — a vast, ever-changing procedurally-generated map that changes with every game. Choose from a variety of daring prospectors, each with their own abilities and tools. Whether you want to be a brave pilot holding down the ship or a clever trickster boarding enemy ships, there's no wrong way to commit space crimes! The Reach is a dangerous, unpredictable place, filled with deadly hazards and treasure beyond your wildest dreams. Navigate through cosmic storms, battle space creatures, and plunder ancient alien ruins for lost caches of loot. Just make sure you beat the other prospectors to the punch, or you'll fly away empty-handed!",
