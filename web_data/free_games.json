        "description": "Some people find it too hard, some too easy, and some juuuust right. If you enjoy having to think on your feet and make quick decisions while evading hazards, you'll prob have fun with this game. If you want something super easy/chilled, you might want to try something else. Congratulations! You and your friends are graduating from the prestigious Intergalactic Time Academy. No time for partying though as your first mission awaits! The Orbees are all missing. Yes, those curious little beings made of energy who power our time-tech are nowhere to be fou... no, wait! We have a faint trace on their signal. Are you brave enough to rescue them? Prepare yourself for unknown dangers. If you find some of the Orbees they might equip your Space-Time Machine with new tech. Decide who is in charge of each gadget and combine your abilities to discover the best strategies. Use cunning, comradeship and co-operation to survive and never forget the Academy motto: “BFF or Die!” Best Friends Forever BFF or Die is a game for you if: You want a 2-4 player game to play with your partner/family/friends where you get to do everything as a team. Pure co-operation sounds fun to you as it’s a different feeling when you all work together. You like games that are easy to start playing but then gradually get more challenging. You like games that let you figure things out yourself rather than “hand holding” you too much and telling you what to do. You want a game with a fun, short campaign mode which adds replayability by having difficult trophies to collect and also an unlockable “Infinite” mode. Is There Online Multiplayer? You can play with your friends online by using Steam's new \"Remote Play Together\" feature, or by using Parsec. Read our Steam community posts about it to find out more. What to Expect We strongly recommend playing in 2, 3 or 4 player mode as this is when the game is most fun. Playtime will vary depending on your skill level but as a guide: 1-Player story game: 2-3 hours 2-Player story game: 2-3 hours 3-Player story game: 2-3 hours 4-Player story game: 2-3 hours “The Infinite Trials”: 1-999 hours! Or maybe ∞ hours :) Complete as many randomised/procedural levels in a row as you can without losing. Go back to the start if you die. You can either share controllers (two people per controller) or have separate controllers. As a minimum you need the keyboard and one control pad to have a 4-player game. Or you can use four separate control pads, it’s up to you. There’s a story mode with 30 levels followed by an unlockable “Infinite Trials” mode with challenging randomised/procedural levels. The game will feel different depending on how many people play. Levels also change around when the number of players change. The characters’ story text will change depending on which characters you pick. Each mode has a different set of trophies. If you want a complete set you will need to complete all modes. Our Favourite Quotes from (English) Steam Reviews :) “It's cute, fun, challenging, intense, and funny.” - Skaginator “The game is like a physical puzzle game but with action elements to it.” - Spoon Thumb \"Lots of fun! started playing it with friends and once we got started couldnt stop until we finished it! Strongly recommend it if you are looking for a couch co op game!\" - CimYwjSiab “A guaranteed good time for a group of friends or family!” - Dr Davient “Similar to games like Overcooked, this is as much about communicating with each other as it is what you are actually doing on the screen” - Pug2980 \"If you are looking for a couple of hours of local co-op fun, you cant go wrong here.\" - GamingGideon “I can't wait to have a few friends come over for a game, so we can have a go with the local multi-player mode as well.” - gorm \"... let's hear it for more games that make our world a better place and make a night gaming with friends end with everyone feeling closer and better.\" - Arkade \"BFF or Die has all the good stuff from the couch co-op genre, with some stylish quirks thrown in, including an innovative UX\" - One Third Nerd \"It’s the kind of game I’d recommend when you’ve got a few friends over looking for something fun to do!\" - Flom \"Definitely a fun game to play with friends. Even though it's short, you won't be short on laughs and good times in this game.\" - Tanaka Naoki",

        "description": "Low wage. Exhaustion. Expensive fish and chips. Welcome to the United Kingdom. DIGGERGUN is an oppressive life sim platformer about workers, minimum pay and the environment. You’re trapped on a blustery island, forced to work at Cornwall Mining Corp where it’s shadier than the game’s monochrome palette. To escape, you need to earn £3000 from digging precious lithium. To survive, you need to manage your time, energy and money during the rigid day-and-night cycle. Will you make ends meet while digging for freedom or find another way out and bring down the whole bloomin’ system? Features: An atmospheric world with fleshed-out characters; everyone you meet has their own distinct personality and storyline. Multiple endings: who you interact with (or don’t) will change the outcome of your story. Unique energy system where your actions truly matter as the game tracks your gameplay and punishes/rewards you for your choices. Life sim where wages, food, rent, and much more are based on the current cost-of-living in the United Kingdom. There's even a tax system calculated to real-world rates! Diverse range of randomly generated mines and intricately hand-designed levels to ensure you’re always kept on your toes.",

        "description": "Step into the definitive re-release of two dark spell-casting shooters that shaped the genre. Forged by Raven Software on a modified DOOM engine, Heretic and Hexen were released in 1994 and 1995, pushing first person shooters into bold new territory. These innovative cult classics introduced groundbreaking features like inventory systems, vertical aiming, and distinct character classes, reshaping first person action games for generations to come. This enhanced restoration makes Heretic + Hexen available to new audiences and long-time fans with expanded accessibility across more platforms and languages than ever before. Whether you're returning to these shadowy realms or discovering them for the first time, an epic legacy awaits.

About the Included Games Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders Three brothers, known as the Serpent Riders, used their powerful magic to possess and corrupt the seven kings of the realm, plunging it into war and chaos. But a race of elves known as the Sidhe resisted and were branded heretics. On the brink of losing the war, the Sidhe elders sacrificed themselves and the elven capital city to destroy the seven kings and their armies. As one of the few surviving elves, you embark on a quest for vengeance against those who slaughtered your friends, family, and entire race. Heretic: Faith Renewed [NEW] Years after the planes were cleansed of D'Sparil's wretched influence, a wandering warrior in search of home arrives at a foreign land to discover the blighted stains of that old time religion seeping through the cracks of society once more. In the fortified city, zealous acolytes stand high atop a decadent cathedral and listen to the lamentations echoing from the streets as non-believers are dragged away for 'correction.' The shadow of D'Sparil lingers after death, his absence attributed to apotheosis. Once revered, now worshipped, deserving of neither. An all-too-familiar scene, and one you simply cannot stomach. Taking up the mantle of Heretic once more, you stride into the city, staff in hand, to silence the echoes of your arch-nemesis. Hexen: Beyond Heretic While the Sidhe elf Corvus battled the evil forces of D'Sparil, the remaining two Serpent Riders were busy sowing the seeds of destruction in other dimensions. As a Warrior, Mage, or Cleric, you must fight the undead and brave elemental dungeons and decaying wilderness to defend your realm of Cronos from Korax, the second Serpent Rider. Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel After defeating the evil Korax, the second Serpent Rider, and discovering the Chaos Sphere, you have been transported to the Realm of the Dead. Now your only way home is blocked by hordes of undead and the Dark Citadel. Where Hexen ends, the true nightmare begins. Hexen: Vestiges of Grandeur [NEW] Korax lingers between life and death, his shredded corpse left behind with no semblance of life while he clings to a fresh, if fragile, rebirth. His grip on Cronos is once more released, yet the cycle continues, proving another force is at work: an invisible hand puppeteering both Korax and you, weaving a star-crossed destiny that will never die. And if that hand tugs the threads of fate again, what surprises are yet in store for you?",

        "description": "EXFIL delivers a distilled, authentic tactical experience where every match challenges your decision-making, teamwork and situational awareness. Built for players who value realism, EXFIL strips away grinding, magical perks and ‘gear fear’ to focus on pure tactical combat at infantry level. The Early Access release includes four intense extraction game modes: • Classic Extraction : Compete to secure intel and escape. Only one team will make it out alive. • Rogue Extraction : A high-stakes asymmetrical mode where a small rogue team of must outmaneuver a larger force to escape with valuable intel. • Search And Destroy : One team must work together to locate and destroy multiple anti-air defense systems positioned across the map, while the opposing team’s objective is to protect these assets at all costs. • VIP : One team must defend their high-value target, while the opposing team’s mission is to locate and eliminate the VIP before the match ends. EXFIL’s objective-based gameplay is fast-paced and straight to the point, offering infantry combat that balances realism with accessibility. Whether playing solo, teaming up with friends, or squaring off against other players, you’ll experience scenarios that demand tight communication, calculated movement, and sharp tactical skills. It’s not just other players you’ll have to contend with - local forces are organized into squads that dynamically patrol, guard key locations, and actively hunt down threats across the map, keeping every match unpredictable and dangerous. Immersive and Dynamic Environments Fight across seven handcrafted maps featuring dense forests, industrial zones, military camps and tropical jungles. With a 24-hour day/night cycle and fully simulated weather systems, matches are always unpredictable and ever-changing. Sandstorms, fog, and rainstorms will push your adaptability and ‘on-the-fly’ team tactics to the limit. Hardcore Realism, No Nonsense EXFIL’s fully simulated ballistics model accounts for bullet drop, penetration and ricochet. Combine this with realistic player movement, weapon handling, and VOIP-enhanced communication - including proximity chat, and every match becomes a test of skill and strategy. ⦁ Built for the Community With a dedicated Discord community of over 3,000 members, EXFIL is constantly evolving based on player feedback. Self-hosted servers and dedicated hosting options give you precise control over gameplay rules and settings, whilst detailed after-action reviews allow teams to analyze every hit, shot, and movement. A Sandbox of Possibilities EXFIL is more than just its core game modes. Players have the freedom to customize their experience by adjusting a wide range of game parameters - from AI presence on the map to time of day, weather, available weapons, and respawn rules - allowing them to create unique challenges, and playstyles to suit any preference. Early Access and Beyond The Early Access launch is just the beginning. Over the next 12-18 months, we’re focused on expanding the toolset, adding new features and building a game shaped by the community. Expect NPC opposition forces, new modes, global stats tracking, loadout customization and more as we continue to grow EXFIL into the ultimate tactical sandbox. Whether you're looking for quick, intense battles or tools to create your own scenarios, EXFIL is your playground for tactical combat without compromise.",

        "description": "Felix The Reaper is a challenging single-player puzzle game . You take on the role as Felix, whose job is to make sure that people die . To do this, Felix must work in the shadows and rearrange faith so that death is always the end result. At its core, the game is about manipulating shadows so that Felix can set up his targets safely covered by the shadows. The core gameplay has a Hitman Go'ish, Monument Valley'ing and Sokoban-like simplicity running through it. There are three rules you have to master to become a successful Reaper: Rule #1: Stick to the shadows Each level is set on a grid-based platform. The squares of the grid are either lit up or in shadow, and Felix has to do his job in the shadows. Rule #2: Control the shadows Felix has the ability to rotate the sun, and move objects, to create new pathways for him to reach his target. Rule #3: Make sure people die The end goal of each level is to set up your targets and have them meet their maker. To add something extra to this core game experience, we wrapped it in deep layers of storytelling, death, dance, art history, love and comedy. That way you get to enjoy a wholesome story world, while boiling your brains on complicatedly straight forward shadow puzzles about Death. Challenging single-player puzzle game . Take on the job as The Reaper and make sure people die . Make sure to stay in the shadows . Light is the domain of life. Not good. Control the shadows to reach your target. Enjoy a framing narrative of dangerous love and peculiar characters. Dance along with Felix to an original soundtrack from 10+ indie music artists. Unlock time trials and hardcore levels for an extra challenge. Felix The Reaper sprang from a fascination with the sprawling, humorous and grotesque art history of Death. Many themes have emerged in the cultural identity of Death, including The Dance of Death or Danse Macabre and Death And The Maiden . We sort of mashed those two themes together in Felix The Reaper. For the character himself and the world around him, the inspiration was more diverse: We took cues from the ancient TV show The Twilight Zon e, medieval painters like Bruegel and Bosch and the cartoon characters of Adventure Time and Hayao Miyazaki . Another important inspiration for Felix The Reaper was the amazing artistic collaborators in the production. We worked with dancers, a long list of music artists and history scholars. The Dance Several dancers contributed to the game's production, and eventually Gunilla Lind and Raphaël Ferdinand Eder-Kastling improvised the final moves that ended up in the game. Here's Gunilla doing a dance move for Felix: And here's Raphael doing another: The Music Of course a game with a dancing protagonist needs great music—why else would he be dancing? We designed the game in a way that lets the music artists be themselves. We wanted them to add to the game through their personal artistic expression, rather than ask them to be what we want them to be. This made for a varied and strange combination of music. But since the gameplay is a non-stressful puzzler, you actually have time to appreciate and enjoy the weirdness while playing. The Art History The idea for the game itself stems from art history. We actually started with The Danse Macabre and Death and The Maiden as a basis, and then asked ourselves: How can we make a game about this? Eventually and through several different prototypes, we ended up here. Alongside the production, a history scholar was diving into the art history of Death across more than 10 centuries for a book manuscript he is working on, and every time he hit upon something interesting he told us, and we tried to put it into the game if it fit. There are five different articles by this historian Søren Hein Rasmussen within the game—you can unlock them as you progress.",

        "description": "Monkey Land 3D: Reaper Rush is 100% full of gameplay! There's bananas, treasure coins, Piggys in need of saving, locked treasure chests and thats just in the first 10 seconds! Find new abilities like the STOMPY-BUTT by finding the precious Dinosaur Feathers! You can also find and unlock the DOUBLE JUMP, the DASH ATTACK, and unleash a 3 hit combo DRAGON BACKFLIP that can also do GATE CRUSHING amounts of damage! Find weapons, power ups, kill monsters, fight bosses, beat time trials, explore huge worlds, and help out the inslanders all in Monkey Land 3D: Reaper Rush! Mugen is a pirate monkey out on a quest for adventure... and booty! His crew has landed on a strange island that looks like fun and games but something is strange about the islands inhabitants. Some are locked up in cages and they don't know why? Only Mugen can save them and find out who or what is behind all the mischief! Weapons like the Morning Star make swords look lame. A SPIKED BALL of DOOM on a chain is so much more fun than a sword! But a Sword with Lightning going through it is pretty fun indeed! Both of these weapons just need to be found and picked up to have for the rest of the game! The Piggys of Volcano Island and the Golden Butterflies are being kept prisoner all over on the island and only you can free them. The Viking Helmet and Viking Shield will be your protection. But you might find your own protection like that spike shelled turtle over there can probably be used as a weapon and defense! The Owl-Crates around the island hold power-ups too so be sure to SMASH all the BOXES! Watch out for Skeleton Wizards of dark magic and the evil Saber-toothed Bats! The creepy spiders will be sure to come after you. The Firefly demons are mostly harmless so it's not all bad. But the spiked shell turtles can be quite fast by the water front so be careful. The Pumpkins are extra bouncy this time of year too. The Squishy Fishy's are not so squishy and shoot deadly poison stars so be extra careful near water! And one last thing, use the Banana button to pause and go to options and use the Heart button to adjust the camera. You can adjust the control placement in the Options menu and be sure to unlock all the levels by BEATING the GAME! And do replay after you beat a certain someone because there might just be a special thing like a reward for beating the game but nobody knows for sure what it is! Boss fighting can be dangerous so make sure you have found at least one weapon before trying to take on the last boss. I mean unless you want to be some crazy hero that don't need no weapons to defeat the game then by all means, be my guest. Take your best shot, that little head is probably the weakest spot. Oh and one more thing, the new abilities you get from the treasure chests, they come in a different order every time you start a new game so you might get an ability you really really want at first, and you might get it last! It's what the kids call procedural random gameplay and it's so hot right now! Single Player Adventure with HOURS of gameplay! Unlock special abilities like Double Jump and Dash Attack! Boost off pumpkins to get to super high places! Side quests with POWERFUL rewards! Boss Fights that require EXTREME fighting action! Huge levels are like mini worlds and can be explored all over! Power ups like Big Mode, Speed Boost, Triple Jump, Tiny Mode, and more! Sword fighting action! Melee weapons with PHYSICS like the spiked ball and chain weapons! Randomly generated chests make each play through unique! Percent based completion, can you beat Reaper Rush to 100% completion? Let us know what you think about Monkey Land 3D: Reaper Rush!",

        "description": "In this first-person adventure game, you’ll follow the story of a young man who, unknowingly, has been thrown into a world where the rules of logic have been left behind. It all begins with a seemingly simple mission: buying eggs for his mother. But what seemed like an everyday task transforms into an extraordinary experience, thanks to a group of cosmic comedians armed with magical text boxes that write comments coming to life and altering the world in real time. As you progress, you’ll witness situations ranging from hilarious to utterly absurd. You might find yourself speeding through a jelly-like landscape in a car or piloting a drone solely to track animals that seem more interested in mocking you than being found. The comedians don’t just sit back and watch; they constantly introduce random challenges that will test your skills and creativity, from frantic races against flying snails to solving puzzles with answers that only make sense in their twisted universe. The game doesn’t fall short on modes and mechanics: you’ll explore a variety of worlds and levels that feel like they’ve been plucked from a delirious dream, each filled with side quests designed to challenge you. From collecting impossible objects to participating in utterly ridiculous talent competitions, there’s never a dull moment. Each level is packed with secrets and hidden paths, rewarding the most observant players with unexpected \"and often comically useless\" discoveries. The blend of a surreal narrative, unpredictable events, and constant interaction with the comedians “writing” the world ensures that every playthrough is unique. While absurd humor lies at the heart of the game, you’ll also encounter genuine challenges that will test your skills as a player. Get ready to laugh, get frustrated, and be surprised as you embark on an adventure where the ordinary becomes extraordinary, and you’ll never be able to guess what happens next.",

        "description": "Carnival Heroes is cross-platform online multiplayer board game for 2 to 4 players similar to super mario party. Inside the game you will enjoy 24 minigames which you play along the main game. The game can be played in 2 game modes: online (vs real human players or solo (vs AI). GAMEPLAY You take turns in an order determined by the biggest dice roll. On your turn you roll a dice and you use (or not) an item you previously collected. The goal in the game is to collect as many crowns as possible. Crowns are bought with gems. Gems you collect by walking onto the game board, by landing on chests or by winning in minigames. At the start of the game you choose animal avatar which you will play as. Each of the 8 avatars comes with a special dice which you can play if you want (you either play the regular 1 to 6 dice or the character special dice). The game has two main gameplay modes: FREE and FIXED. In FIXED mode you walk along a fixed routers. But you still choose which direction to go on the intersections. In FREE mode you draw your exact path on which you player will go. You have to make sure you make most of your path (i.e. it goes through many gems, mates and it lands on a board item. BOARD ITEMS Gems. These are diamonds in 3 colors: red = 1 gem, green = 2 gems and blue = 3 gems. Gems are used to purchase crows or items from the store. Crowns. This is what you must be aiming to get. Crowns are bought with gems. In the beginning of the game 1 crown costs 10 gems..but as the game progresses they will become more and more expensive (15 or 20 gems). Mates. Mates are special animal friends which will follow you onto the game board and will give you gems for each player you jump over (i.e. pass through its place). Each mate you have, will give you additional big dice that you can roll instead of the regular 1 to 6 dice. Moreover, mates have their own small dice that they will roll with you and it will be added to your dice value. Chests. These will give you random prize in form of items or gems. Items are inventory stuff which you can use throughout the game (dice addons, portals or many other special items). Events. Shown as questionmarks on the board, events are immediate actions like teleportations, crown movement traffic light switchings and others. Battle. Landing on battle will force all players to bet a random amount of gems and play in a randomly chosen minigame. The winner takes it all Hidden gifts. These are hidden fields (empty cells) which you don't see. If you land on a hidden gift, you will get a random prize or a bomb. Positive gifts are gems, mates or items. Negative gifts are gems taken from you or losing a mate. Traffic Lights, These switches are giving you 2 routes to pass: free one and a paid one. Paid route costs X gems to pass. On each pass it increases its price with 1. Cracked tiles. Some tiles get cracks once a player lands on them. When the crack gets big enough, the last player passing through it will pay small gems tax to repair the crack. Stores. If you land on a store, you have the option to buy an item. Items usually cost 2-3-4-5 gems. Once all items are bought from the store, new ones will be automatically added. MINIGAMES Aether Drift: You fly in a 3D space station and have to survive against the flying aliens (and be the fastest to reach the final line) aMaze Memory: Escape the maze before the timer runs out.

        "description": "As an avid Sudoku enthusiast, I could not find a satisfying Sudoku game on Steam, so I started learning the programming language, and based on my understanding of Sudoku and the experience of other games of the same type, I created a new Sudoku game - Meta Sudoku in a few weeks, whether you are a novice or an experienced Sudoku master, this game will meet your gaming needs. Meta Sudoku is a minimalist puzzle game, your only goal is to fill in the nine numbers 1, 2, 3, and up to 9 in the spaces in a 9 X 9 square according to the numbers given by the system, so that each row, column, and every 3 X 3 palace contains the nine numbers 1~9, and there are no repetitions and omissions. The rules of the game are simple, but finding all the numbers that fit the rules can be challenging. Meta Sudoku is great for exercising your brain while relaxing at leisure, and it provides players with the most comfortable gaming experience. There are four modes of Meta Sudoku: 1. Classic Mode: This mode contains six increasing difficulty levels, namely easy, medium, advanced, difficult, expert, master, and each difficulty level contains 40 levels. 2. Pack mode: This mode contains three increasing difficulty levels, namely Pack I., Pack II., and Pack III., each difficulty level contains 25 levels. Compared to the classic mode, the levels in this mode are more beautiful, and the distribution of the system numbers is like a mysterious geometric pattern. 3. Endless mode: This mode still contains six increasing difficulty levels, namely easy, medium, advanced, difficult, expert, master, each time you enter a new level, the system will carefully select a level that belongs to you. 4. Ultimate Mode: This mode contains only three levels. These levels are definitely a real test, they were designed by world-class masters themselves, and considering their difficulty, I designed them to the end. I strongly discourage challenging these levels at the beginning, you can try them again once you are familiar with the game mechanics. After completing these levels, you will have a full sense of accomplishment. Game Features: Game: 1. Minimalist interface to provide you with the most comfortable visuals, allowing you to focus on the fun of the game 2. There are multiple color themes in the game for you to choose and replace to avoid aesthetic fatigue as much as possible 3. Several quiet, comfortable and relaxing ambient music to relieve your brain fatigue 4. Multiple mechanisms reduce the likelihood of optical illusions 5. Support the operation of withdrawal and recovery, you have the opportunity to repent. 6. Support the hint function of remaining numbers to save game time as much as possible 7. Support shortcut keys, which improves the convenience and flexibility of operation, allowing you to pay more attention to the logic of the number itself 8. Exiting halfway will save time and progress (if you don't want to use this function, you can change it in the setting interface) 9. Support English, Russian, Chinese, French and other languages [/i][/list] Steam: 1. Support Steam cloud save 2. There are some simple style achievements that you need to complete 3. Ultra-low pricing with frequent discounts 4. In the future, gradually add trading cards, Steam badges and other functions [/i][/list] -------------------------------------------------------- The audio in the game is all from royalty-free files provided by excellent sites like freeSound. If you encounter any problems with the game, or want to give me some comments and suggestions, or even just want to say hello, you can contact me through the Steam community or email. I will try to find time to communicate with you as pleasantly as possible. I apologize if I didn't respond to your message in a timely manner, probably due to negligence or busy work. I will try to avoid this from happening. Your support and input are crucial to me, and I will continue to improve the game to ensure it performs at its best in all aspects. Finally, thank you again for taking the time to read this article, please enjoy your Sudoku journey to the fullest! ——————Matrix Science This page is translated using ChatGPT, if you find any misleading content, false transmission, or culturally sensitive issues during use, please contact me to update.

Climate change has caused sea levels to rise, flooding coastal cities and displacing millions of people. The old world order has collapsed, and three powerful factions have emerged to vie for control of the planet, each with a different vision for the new world. Gone are the days of conventional warfare; now, cutting-edge war machines like futuristic aircraft carriers, stealthy submarines, and powerful destroyers take center stage. Human technology advances at an unprecedented pace, resulting in the creation of the ultimate war machine: the AI Scourge Legion. However, the relentless evolution of AI technology endows the Scourge Legion with autonomous consciousness, prompting it to seek control over Earth. Each of the three factions believes that they can defeat the AI Scourge Legion and become the new rulers of the planet. As a skilled military commander, players must choose a faction, lead its development, strive to unite the world under their banner, and ultimately become the master of the new world! ★Precise restoration of legendary warships★ Over 150 legendary warships, submarines and aircraft carriers are restored precisely in the game, enabling players to build a loyal naval fleet. ★Classic styles of sea wars! Just sink all the enemy warships★ Aim for the ocean! Feel the excitement and the glory in the warship battles while you are conquering the world! ★Diverse warship gears for you to DIY to handle all kinds of battlefield★ Automatic artillery, anti-aircraft guns, armor, radar, propulsion devices and other gears can all be freely constructed by yourself. How to survive in the dangerous battlefield? It all depends on you, the commander! ★Dominate the vast sea area with Air and Sea armies★ Build a fighter workshop to load carrier-exclusive fighter jets. Milanese and Raptor fighter jets are always at your service. ★Only the strong ones can survive in the storm-like wars★ There are still many more commanders with superior wisdom and strength among three allied countries. Who can be the best of them to unify the three forces? ★Be the leader of the battlefield by the cross-generation high technology★ Storing up energy and working on future technologies will give you a chance to win from the start and bring higher battle effectiveness to your warships!",
