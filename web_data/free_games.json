        "description": "Jack the Ripper is hiding among us. Can you find him? In this turn-based detection game, two teams face off against each other: Jack the Ripper and the detectives. Jack has to get away with murder without being found out by the detectives, who in turn need to find out who he is. Unlike other detection games, you can't talk with the other players in Jack & Detectives, and you must figure out the truth based only on their actions. Players cannot get eliminated, so everyone gets to enjoy the game to its end. Furthermore, since a game only last ten minutes, you don't need to commit a lot of time just to play.

Detectives: Find Jack, who is hidden among us. Private detectives hired by the London police. In order to win, they must correctly vote Jack out during the voting phase. Jack maniac: Muddy the waters so that Jack isn't found. A maniac whose allegiance lies with Jack the Ripper. He wins if Jack wins, even if he gets voted out himself. The detectives must plan their moves to corner the suspect among them! At the start of each game, players are assigned a role at random. Then, everyone places their token on a London tile of their choosing. Jack must trick them and frame one of them! Once they have done so, night will fall, and Jack the Ripper will commit his first murder. (In certain cases, there will be no murder during the first night) Vote to choose whom to arrest! The detectives located near the crime scene will become suspects. Who's on justice's side? Who's the murderer among us? After the second murder, the voting phase starts. Everyone has to vote for the person that they think is secretly Jack the Ripper. This is where the real battle of wits between the detectives and Jack starts. ■ Cross-platform online play You can play online against console and mobile users. ■ Play against people from all over the world Win matches against worldwide challengers to earn rank points.

Or rather, he used to rule the beautiful kingdom of Faeryanis, until the brave people revolted against his regime and drove him out of the palace. The kindhearted queen Gwendolyn did step up to reign over the land with a council of noble and wise advisors.. It seems that this story could end just like any other fairy tale: \"And they lived happily ever after...\" But no, that's not quite right. Because another evil rises within the land. The treacherous Basilus — counsellor of Gwendolyn and of Ceville before her — plans to take the crown and torture the realm with the help of murderous beasts he has summoned from the planes of eternal darkness. All seems lost! But hope resides with the one most unlikely person imaginable to save the kingdom and restore peace to the realm: Ceville, the realm's former despotic ruler... Ceville The ancient ruler of Faeryanis and spare-time tyrant, is dreaming up evil plans to exact his revenge on his former counsellor and servant Basilus, who betrayed him. Ambrosius The noble and somewhat self-important knight Ambrosius is Ceville's would-be-nemesis. He constantly attempts to capture Ceville — but usually with little success. Will they both team up to fight a greater evil? Lilly The gentle and kind girl Lilly is rather an improbable choice to team up with Ceville. Never the less she helps him to escape for the good of the realm (at least that's what SHE thinks!) This game will give you an impression of what happens, when you mix up the setting and humour of Shrek, Discworld and the Monkey Island series. up to three simultaniously playable characters with weird but loveable personalities bizarre characters from stock-broker dwarves and hippie-elves who populate the fairy-tale realm of Faeryanis various locations all over Faerynis, like the Not-So-Hidden druid circle, the (former) Elven Forest, The Dwarven Mines of Mount Goldmore and more! a variety of puzzles, many of which that can only be solved by teamwork of two (or more) player characters tons of humour",

        "description": "SETTING The Eastern Front, the most decisive theatre of World War II and the largest land battlefield. A fight to the end, Total War between the Third Reich and the Soviet Union, each commanding millions. The legendary wargame team at 2by3 Games has spent years revisiting this titanic conflict to once again establish a new state of the art. Gary Grigsby’s War in the East 2 is a complete overhaul and improvement of the original War in the East, with no stone left unturned to provide a more realistic, more historically rich, and more challenging strategy experience. War in the East 2 comes with a wide array of scenarios ranging from the short tutorial on the Battle for Velikie Luki, to the four month Destruction of Southwest Front, up to the immense full 1941 – 1945 Grand Campaign of the entire Eastern front from Operation Barbarossa to the fall of Berlin. A total of seven Operational Scenarios and three Full Map Campaigns await you with hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of historical gameplay. Years of new development have resulted in the best AI opponent ever made by 2by3 for any of their game. Also included are a much more accurate map including a full single and double rail network as well as the historical road network, a detailed and expanded Order of Battle, new realistic movement and combat models, an advanced Logistics system, a vastly improved and easy to manage Air system and many other improvements in the interface and game management, as well as a built-in encyclopedia of the weapons and units of the Eastern Front. This is just scratching the surface of the many new features and improvements, all of which are explained in a fully comprehensive manual, also available as a physical copy. FEATURES 3 Full Map Campaigns - 1941-45 Campaign (June 22 1941 – 1 August 1945) - Stalingrad to Berlin (November 19 1942 – 4 July 1945) - Vistula to Berlin (13 January 1945 – 1 June 1945) 7 Smaller Operational Scenarios - Velikie Luki ’42 (17 November 1942 – 25 January 1943) – The Soviet counterattack to recapture this important rail junction. - Road to Minsk (22 June 1941 – July 2 1941) – The rush to the Dnepr by Army Group Center. - Road to Leningrad (22 June 41 – 8 Oct 41) – Army Group North moves on Leningrad. - The Destruction of Southwest Front (22 June 41 – 15 October 41) – Army Group South and Guderian cause the largest Soviet surrender in the war. - Operation Typhoon 41 (30 September 1941 – 5 January 1942) – The final offensive to take Moscow. - Red Army Resurgent (19 November 1942 – 17 March 1943) – The destruction of the German 6th Army at Stalingrad. - Red God of War (24 November 1942 – 8 February 1943) – The failed Soviet northern offensive. Improved AI Opponent - Newly re-designed and re-built by Gary Grigsby for War in the East 2 - Greatly enhanced Defensive AI performance as well as improved Offensive AI performance More Accurate Map and Movement rules: - Map based on better projection yields a larger number of hexes in the main combat area (106 hex frontage from Rostov to Leningrad versus 87 in WitE). - Advanced Terrain/Road rules – Road quality in every hex combines with terrain to generate much more realistic impacts of terrain on movement, combat and supplies. - Administrative Movement – Accounts for ability to move rapidly in friendly territory, especially where there are better roads. - Ability to stack additional units into urban and port hexes Off-Map Theater Boxes and Theater Events: - Theater boxes representing other theaters of the war (North Africa, Italy, etc.), and a full set of events including garrison requirements in the TBs along with other events like partisan operations. - Partisan war now handled with a Soviet Union garrison box, events, and partisan interdiction placed on map. - Enhanced Player Theater Box Control game option that allows players to choose more flexible movement of units between theaters, but at a cost for failing to meet garrison requirements versus benefits for exceeding them. - More accurate historical line up of units, HQs and support units and their historical movement between theaters. - Additional historical campaign events. Improved Air System incorporating both a more Advanced Air Mode and a Streamlined Air Operational Group Mode - On Map Airbases - Much more realistic Air Combat and Support Resolution compared to War in the East and War in the West. - A separate Air Phase is now used for many air actions, with ground support and transport done in the movement phase. - Advanced Air Mode allows full detailed control of the entire Air War, equivalent to a game within a game. - New “Air Operational Group” Mode which allows you to move Air Groups on the map and provides an easy and streamlined way to manage the air game while focusing on the ground game. This makes the air game easier to manage even for those players that want full control. - Full AI Air Assist that can run most of the air operations based on just a few orders given by the player to the Air Operational Groups. More accurate and detailed historical weather model incorporating per-hex Weather changes based on the system developed for War in the West. Changes in Ground Combat to reflect Historical operations: - New Combat Preparation Points for units allow for build ups for better offensive operations and punish units that are in combat every turn without a rest. - Combat Delay Points account for the time spent fighting in a hex and will slow units that move through a hex where significant combat took place that turn. - Attacks can now deprive defending units of future MPs. - Multi-hex retreats. Many interface improvements, including new art, reorganized screens, a new Turn Summary and more important information regarding your units and situation brought to the top level for easier discovery and quicker access. Automated Soviet factory evacuation. Improved Commander’s Report screens with more flexibility and CSV export capability for out of game analysis. Special designation of Assault HQs allowing Command benefits for offensive armies at the cost of some defensive abilities. Increased Command cost of integrating multiple nationalities under the same command. Greater direct attachment of support units to certain Soviet and Axis Allied divisions, along with multi-role units that can be on map or used as support. New In-Game WitEpedia – Includes Detailed Information and Links concerning units and weapons of the Eastern Front. Detailed TO&E and Order of Battle Charts with information about many of the units on the Eastern Front. 520 Page full color manual, including appendices and designer's notes fully documenting every aspect of the game. The additional Physical version (only) comes with a hardbound full color printed manual.",

        "description": "Step into the definitive re-release of two dark spell-casting shooters that shaped the genre. Forged by Raven Software on a modified DOOM engine, Heretic and Hexen were released in 1994 and 1995, pushing first person shooters into bold new territory. These innovative cult classics introduced groundbreaking features like inventory systems, vertical aiming, and distinct character classes, reshaping first person action games for generations to come. This enhanced restoration makes Heretic + Hexen available to new audiences and long-time fans with expanded accessibility across more platforms and languages than ever before. Whether you're returning to these shadowy realms or discovering them for the first time, an epic legacy awaits. Owners Receive Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders¹ Hexen: Beyond Heretic¹ Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel¹ Two all-new episodes created in collaboration between individuals at id Software + Nightdive Studios: Heretic: Faith Renewed Hexen: Vestiges of Grandeur There are a total of 117 campaign maps and 120 deathmatch maps in Heretic + Hexen.

About the Included Games Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders Three brothers, known as the Serpent Riders, used their powerful magic to possess and corrupt the seven kings of the realm, plunging it into war and chaos. But a race of elves known as the Sidhe resisted and were branded heretics. On the brink of losing the war, the Sidhe elders sacrificed themselves and the elven capital city to destroy the seven kings and their armies. As one of the few surviving elves, you embark on a quest for vengeance against those who slaughtered your friends, family, and entire race. Heretic: Faith Renewed [NEW] Years after the planes were cleansed of D'Sparil's wretched influence, a wandering warrior in search of home arrives at a foreign land to discover the blighted stains of that old time religion seeping through the cracks of society once more. In the fortified city, zealous acolytes stand high atop a decadent cathedral and listen to the lamentations echoing from the streets as non-believers are dragged away for 'correction.' The shadow of D'Sparil lingers after death, his absence attributed to apotheosis. Once revered, now worshipped, deserving of neither. An all-too-familiar scene, and one you simply cannot stomach. Taking up the mantle of Heretic once more, you stride into the city, staff in hand, to silence the echoes of your arch-nemesis. Hexen: Beyond Heretic While the Sidhe elf Corvus battled the evil forces of D'Sparil, the remaining two Serpent Riders were busy sowing the seeds of destruction in other dimensions. As a Warrior, Mage, or Cleric, you must fight the undead and brave elemental dungeons and decaying wilderness to defend your realm of Cronos from Korax, the second Serpent Rider. Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel After defeating the evil Korax, the second Serpent Rider, and discovering the Chaos Sphere, you have been transported to the Realm of the Dead. Now your only way home is blocked by hordes of undead and the Dark Citadel. Where Hexen ends, the true nightmare begins. Hexen: Vestiges of Grandeur [NEW] Korax lingers between life and death, his shredded corpse left behind with no semblance of life while he clings to a fresh, if fragile, rebirth. His grip on Cronos is once more released, yet the cycle continues, proving another force is at work: an invisible hand puppeteering both Korax and you, weaving a star-crossed destiny that will never die. And if that hand tugs the threads of fate again, what surprises are yet in store for you?",

        "description": "Hello r/AppHookup ! I have built a small utility app for myself that can transcribe live speech or files without needing an internet connection. It also supports multiple languages and runs locally so guarantees privacy. I made this for my study and work related needs and it proved very useful. It uses a compressed version of OpenAI's Whisper model under the hood and runs the model with phone hardware without needing to send any kind of speech data online thus ensuring %100 privacy. I have recently fixed some critical bugs causing crashes and improved performance and I am making lifetime version free for 24 hours to celebrate this milestone. Regular Price: $29.99 –> FREE for 24 hours Hope you like it! Feel free to contact me for support, recommendations etc. submitted by /u/slabfurnace [link] [comments]",

In No Man's Sky, every star is the light of a distant sun, each orbited by planets filled with life, and you can go to any of them you choose. Fly smoothly from deep space to planetary surfaces, with no loading screens, and no limits. In this infinite procedurally generated universe, you'll discover places and creatures that no other players have seen before - and perhaps never will again. Now including... Play with all major updates since launch: Foundation, Pathfinder, Atlas Rises, NEXT, The Abyss, Visions, the 2.0 BEYOND update, Synthesis, Living Ship, Exo Mech, Desolation and the 3.0 update, ORIGINS, Next Generation, Companions, Expeditions, Prisms, Frontiers, Sentinel, Outlaws, Endurance, Waypoint (4.0), Fractal, Interceptor, Echoes, Omega, Orbital, Worlds Part I (5.0), Worlds Part II, Relics and Beacon.

Embark on an epic voyage At the centre of the galaxy lies an irresistible pulse which draws you on a journey towards it to learn the true nature of the cosmos. But, facing hostile creatures and fierce pirates, you'll know that death comes at a cost, and survival will be down to the choices you make over how you upgrade your ship, your weapon and suit. Find your own destiny Your voyage through No Man's Sky is up to you. Will you be a fighter, preying on the weak and taking their riches, or taking out pirates for their bounties? Power is yours if you upgrade your ship for speed and weaponry. Or a trader? Find rich resources on forgotten worlds and exploit them for the highest prices. Invest in more cargo space and you'll reap huge rewards. Or perhaps an explorer? Go beyond the known frontier and discover places and things that no one has ever seen before. Upgrade your engines to jump ever farther, and strengthen your suit for survival in toxic environments that would kill the unwary. Share your journey The galaxy is a living, breathing place. Trade convoys travel between stars, factions vie for territory, pirates hunt the unwary, and the police are ever watching. Every other player lives in the same galaxy, and you can choose to share your discoveries with them on a map that spans known space.

        "description": "112 Operator allows you to manage emergency services in any city in the world! Dispatch units, take calls and face situations caused by weather, traffic or changing seasons. Help the city survive escalating events like riots, organized crime, terrorist attacks, cataclysms, natural disasters and many more! Danger has escalated Help on a scale bigger than ever before. The sequel of the award-winning 911 Operator lets you act on many, completely different levels - from taking care of a single neighborhood to coordinating several operators’ work in the world’s biggest metropolises. Full 3D visualization will give you the inside view of your units’ actions. Choose from over 100 000 areas, such as districts, municipalities, and tens of thousands of real cities from all over the world. To all units: a storm is coming… Face the dynamic weather, based on authentic, historical data. Watch the incidents change as day or night comes, traffic increases and seasons pass. Watch out for extreme conditions that may lead to cataclysms and natural disasters. Try to tame big wildfires spreading across the map. Weather isn’t your only problem though - be careful when dealing with terrorist attacks and gang wars. 112, what’s your emergency? Take calls from people in various situations, needing emergency services’ help. You never know who’s on the other side of the line - you might hear a frightening murder story, maybe you’ll have to instruct someone on performing CPR, or keep your nerves while encountering an annoying prankster. It’s my job, ma’am... Choose one of the European cities in completely new Career mode and find out if you’ll manage to climb up to the very top of an operator’s career ladder. Follow the commands of your supervisors and see your actions affecting people you’re in charge of or those who need your help. Sometimes your mistakes will only be followed by a reprimanding e-mail, sometimes they’ll influence your own life. You can also play special scenarios in any city in the world, or make your own rules in the Free Game mode. We need backup! Command the best specialists, using technologically advanced equipment and vehicles. Decide what to use - a SWAT team, Search and Rescue helicopter, or maybe riot gear? When your units arrive at the scene, command them in the tactical view that gives you the full image of the situation. NEW FEATURES IN 112 OPERATOR: 25 times bigger, expandable maps of REAL CITIES with 3D buildings entirely new set of emergency calls and large events completely redesigned campaign mode, with objectives system, emails, and a story day&night, weather, seasons and traffic now influences the duty and the incidents happening new fire mechanic, that can consume entire areas and require dozens of units region specification - gameplay will vary depending on a country legislation and district characteristics (slums / business / residential /industrial / forest etc) new OnSite situation visualization that shows the action precisely and intuitively new team members - doctors, sergeants, dogs, robots, and others! additional dispatchers, that you can assign to districts for help! redesigned equipment, now packed up in entire gears",

        "description": "‘Summer in Mara’ is a summer adventure with farming, crafting, and exploring mechanics set in a tropical archipelago. ‘Summer in Mara’ is a single-player experience in a calm, relaxing environment, with a handmade look and an exciting narrative. You will be Koa, a little adventurer girl who wants to explore the world that surrounds her. In ‘Summer in Mara’ you’ll have to take care of your own island, harvest your crops, create new tools and buildings, and sail with your boat to discover new islands and secrets. KEY FEATURES - An open ocean with over 20 islands to explore. - Customize your own island with buildings, crops, and farm animals. - Over 25 characters to meet and befriend. - More than 300 quests to make Mara a better place. - Day and night cycle that has an effect on the world with climatic events. You’ll have your own island, but taking care of something like that is a lot of hard work. You’ll be able to plant trees to get wood and craft new tools and buildings with different materials. Or you can create crop fields to grow all kinds of vegetables. You’ll also have a farm with chickens and pigs to take care of. But be careful, because this isn’t as easy as it looks! You’ll also be able to fish in a pond or in the open sea, cut trees with your hatchet, build things with your hammer, and use a hoe to help you harvest your island. Koa will need your help. With a basic set of skills, she can acquire new abilities and learn from the world that surrounds her. We want you to feel like you’re growing up with Koa, bonding with her and with all the other people in the archipelago. You’ll be able to sail to new islands and find treasures and other secrets in the middle of the sea with your trusty boat, which you can upgrade with a little effort and time. With new islands come new people. You’ll talk and trade with over twenty characters, each one with their own story and life. They’ll give you quests, hints about the world, or just anecdotes about their experiences and travels. Getting to know them is a significant part of the game, so we put much effort into making them unique and exciting. But not everyone will be friendly. An evil corporation called Elit wants to conquer Mara and exploit the ocean. Napopo is one of their first victims, a strange creature that will seek Koa for help.",

Please see the community page for more details: The Game Disaster! An alien invasion and subsequent infestation have decimated this facility. Many lives were lost, the facility was ruined and the aliens were unstoppable. All hope was lost until one survivor found the courage to fight back and put the aliens in their place! It was a long and horrific battle as the survivor dueled with all manner of terrifying life-forms and alien mutations, but our hero won out in the end and destroyed the alien menace! Humanity was saved! Unfortunately, the alien infestation and the heroic efforts of the courageous survivors have left rather a mess throughout the facility. As the janitor, it is your duty to get this place cleaned up. So grab your mop and roll up your sleeves, this is gonna be one messy job. Today, you're on Viscera Cleanup Detail! Key Features Janitorial Simulation - Step into the boots of a space-station sanitation technician and deal with the horrific aftermath of a sci-fi horror event. Blood, viscera, spent cartridges, worker bodies and other messes litter the facilities. Clean - It's your job to clean up the mess, so clean it up you shall! Use your trusty mop, gloves, dispenser machines, plasma laser and sniffer tool to help you get all that blood out of the floor and off the ceiling! You can even try and punch-out if you think you've done your job. Sandbox Gameplay - Don't want to clean? Just want to make more of a mess and play around with the physics? Go ahead! You can save your game as well; that's kind of us! Multiplayer - You can even enlist some friends/coworkers to come and help you clean up (or make even more mess).
