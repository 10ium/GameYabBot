        "description": "Jack the Ripper is hiding among us. Can you find him? In this turn-based detection game, two teams face off against each other: Jack the Ripper and the detectives. Jack has to get away with murder without being found out by the detectives, who in turn need to find out who he is. Unlike other detection games, you can't talk with the other players in Jack & Detectives, and you must figure out the truth based only on their actions. Players cannot get eliminated, so everyone gets to enjoy the game to its end. Furthermore, since a game only last ten minutes, you don't need to commit a lot of time just to play.

Detectives: Find Jack, who is hidden among us. Private detectives hired by the London police. In order to win, they must correctly vote Jack out during the voting phase. Jack maniac: Muddy the waters so that Jack isn't found. A maniac whose allegiance lies with Jack the Ripper. He wins if Jack wins, even if he gets voted out himself. The detectives must plan their moves to corner the suspect among them! At the start of each game, players are assigned a role at random. Then, everyone places their token on a London tile of their choosing. Jack must trick them and frame one of them! Once they have done so, night will fall, and Jack the Ripper will commit his first murder. (In certain cases, there will be no murder during the first night) Vote to choose whom to arrest! The detectives located near the crime scene will become suspects. Who's on justice's side? Who's the murderer among us? After the second murder, the voting phase starts. Everyone has to vote for the person that they think is secretly Jack the Ripper. This is where the real battle of wits between the detectives and Jack starts. ■ Cross-platform online play You can play online against console and mobile users. ■ Play against people from all over the world Win matches against worldwide challengers to earn rank points.

        "description": "The mean cruel cold blooded tyrant Ceville ruthlessly rules the beautiful kingdom of Faeryanis. Or rather, he used to rule the beautiful kingdom of Faeryanis, until the brave people revolted against his regime and drove him out of the palace. The kindhearted queen Gwendolyn did step up to reign over the land with a council of noble and wise advisors.. It seems that this story could end just like any other fairy tale: \"And they lived happily ever after...\" But no, that's not quite right. Because another evil rises within the land. The treacherous Basilus — counsellor of Gwendolyn and of Ceville before her — plans to take the crown and torture the realm with the help of murderous beasts he has summoned from the planes of eternal darkness. All seems lost! But hope resides with the one most unlikely person imaginable to save the kingdom and restore peace to the realm: Ceville, the realm's former despotic ruler... Ceville The ancient ruler of Faeryanis and spare-time tyrant, is dreaming up evil plans to exact his revenge on his former counsellor and servant Basilus, who betrayed him. Ambrosius The noble and somewhat self-important knight Ambrosius is Ceville's would-be-nemesis. He constantly attempts to capture Ceville — but usually with little success. Will they both team up to fight a greater evil? Lilly The gentle and kind girl Lilly is rather an improbable choice to team up with Ceville. Never the less she helps him to escape for the good of the realm (at least that's what SHE thinks!) This game will give you an impression of what happens, when you mix up the setting and humour of Shrek, Discworld and the Monkey Island series. up to three simultaniously playable characters with weird but loveable personalities bizarre characters from stock-broker dwarves and hippie-elves who populate the fairy-tale realm of Faeryanis various locations all over Faerynis, like the Not-So-Hidden druid circle, the (former) Elven Forest, The Dwarven Mines of Mount Goldmore and more! a variety of puzzles, many of which that can only be solved by teamwork of two (or more) player characters tons of humour",

Generated rise and fall of civilizations, personalities, creatures, cultures, etc. Infinite hours of gameplay. Now with beautiful pixel graphics! Learn the basics with in-game tutorials A lifetime “living” project - created/updated since 2003, with no end in sight Generate your unique world and manage a bustling colony of dwarves, even as they probably mine towards their eventual demise. A new endless hobby, just for you! The legendary Dwarf Fortress is now on Steam! Build a fortress and try to help your dwarves survive, despite threats of starvation, dragons, and madness. In this complex construction/management/roguelike simulation, every generated world brings a unique challenge, whether it’s dwarves with their own simulated personalities or aquifers. Observe what makes your civilization fall into eventual decline, and learn for next time… until something else inevitably goes wrong. The combat model includes skills, body parts, material properties, aimed attacks, wrestling, pain, nausea, various poison effects, and much more. It’s difficult to convey the depth of the generation. Hundreds of animals and monsters, many of which are randomly created for each world, as well as generated poetry, musical forms, instruments, and dances for your dwarves to practice and perform. A dynamic weather model tracks wind, humidity, and air masses to create fronts, clouds, storms, and blizzards. Over two hundred rock and mineral types can appear, in their proper geological environments. Remember: Losing is fun! This is still good old Dwarf Fortress, but with graphics support and music provided. A few bells and whistles won’t change its essence. Classic Dwarf Fortress mod-artist Jacob \"Ironhand\" Bowman collaborated with artists Carolyn Jong and Neoriceisgood to create an all-new sprite pack for the game, which they continue to add to regularly. Dwarf Fortress also has hours of music in a two-volume soundtrack by Dabu and Simon Swerwer, including tracks in the Dwarvish language! It's never been easier to start playing! We've improved the new player experience with the addition of tutorials to guide you through building your first fort and keeping your dwarves happy. Command your dwarves as they search for wealth in their generated mountain. Your dwarves will need a steady supply of food and beer, but they’ll also need your guidance in surviving attacks from hostile civilizations, the wilderness, or even the dead. Craft treasures and furnitures from various materials Establish a barony and support the increasingly demanding nobility Read your dwarves’ thoughts to keep them happy Build floodgates to divert water for farming, and/or prevent magma mishaps Build structures and watch your dwarves discover and build their culture, like taverns, libraries, temples, honey, wax, pottery, animal training, bookbinding, and more. Go anywhere! Explore any civilization, earn a reputation, and recruit followers to join you Experience your fortress and the simulation in a new, more embodied way Explore mythical dungeons to find magical items, artifacts, and fill your quest journal Hints of mythology and magic as a start of future simulation enrichment to come An additional hour of music from Dabu and Simon Swerwer, presented as a second volume of the original soundtrack The original inspiration for RimWorld, Prison Architect, Minecraft and more. One of the first video games acquired by the Museum of Modern Art in New York Updated for over 16 years by two brothers, Tarn “Toady One” and Zach “Threetoe” Adams, and with the support of Kitfox Games since 2020.",

Traverse a completely seamless world using your grapple hook, hoverboard, and a variety of unlockable powers. Epic Battles and Colossal Bosses Embark on a main quest to encounter towering colossi or stumble upon these foes during your explorations.

Flexible Singleplayer and Co-op Gameplay Jump into cooperative play from the start with no mandatory tutorials. Progress on the same save whether in solo or co-op mode, and tailor individual difficulty settings within the same multiplayer session. Note: Co-op play is supported through Steam Friends invites (random matchmaking is not available).

Impeccable teamwork and wise decision-making will be key to beat the overwhelming odds when facing the ever-changing enemies of the wasteland. No one could have foreseen the end of times, but anyone could have prepared for it. You must choose your character and play your part as one of the Guntouchables - a ragtag group of irrepressible survivors who’s been spending years preparing for the direst scenarios imaginable. Now they are facing the disaster of their dreams! Fortune Favors the Bold! Complete mission objectives and collect UpCrates for Cash and Perks that will increase your chances of survival in the wasteland as difficulty gradually escalates. Every second counts, and every reward is associated with a risk. Success must be found in the delicate sweet spot between boldness and greed. Evolving Enemies Between each mission, players must vote between a random selection of mutations that will grant enemies new traits and abilities. Fortunately, this choice will also offer the players immediate or long-term benefits, making the decision less obvious but more critical. Hoard Upgrades Player upgrades are at the heart of the Guntouchables and crucial to help you keep up with the scaling difficulty. Combine common and class-specific perks and abilities to form powerful and creative builds. Mod Your Guns You won't make it long in the apocalypse without the right set of tools. Guntouchables feature a sizable and widely expandable arsenal of high-powered guns. Choose a loadout that fits your style and then mod it with upgrades to your personal preference. A clever combination of perks and gun mods will turn you into an unstoppable mutant killing machine in no time. Open Development Launch will just be the beginning. Guntouchables is designed to be a heavy and easily expandable experience, and any content additions will increase the possible outcomes and combinations exponentially. We want to invite anyone who is interested, to join our community on Discord or follow the game's development on our other channels. We are striving to be as open, fair and transparent as possible about the game's development and launch. We believe this attitude will bring us closer and more in tune with the players, and allow us to make better decisions, and a much more engaging experience, but we ultimately depend on the support from you.",

        "description": "MAINFRAME DEFENDERS Tactical retrofuturistic strategy game. A computer virus has infiltrated the \"Stargazer\" research complex. Most of the robotic units are controlled by the virus. Lead a squad of 4 prototypes on a mission to defend complex mainframe. You'll have to repel assaults, destroy unit fabricators, download valuable data, clear infected nodes, and do more on your way to the deepest parts of the complex. Work with item limitations and drawbacks to build powerful combinations. Destroy your enemies with diverse tactics: overheat them, melt with corrosion, absorb damage, and return fire. But don't rely on a single strategy too much - enemies might have a way to counter it. But above everything else: defend the Mainframe! * RETRO STYLE: Graphics, inspired by 80s terminal PC with hybrid synthwave soundtrack. * DIVERSE TACTICS: Cook enemy robots to death, bury them under your bullets, eliminate with a single powerful shot, or render your opponents useless with debuffs - this game is designed with a lot of viable strategies in mind. * BUILD YOUR SQUAD: Similar to how in card games you have to build your deck, in Mainframe Defenders you have to combine different items with unique abilities, to create an unstoppable squad. Work with item drawbacks or double down on them, creating flawed, yet powerful build! * UNIQUE ENEMIES: Enemy squad won't sit idle, though. Each unit has its own role in the squad and designed to counter certain strategies. Pick your targets wisely, or you will lose. * PROCEDURAL LEVELS: Hand-made rooms are combined with procedural generation to create random levels. Missions have differing objectives, combined with unique mission conditions. Will you accept the challenge or avoid the unknown and risk falling behind? * PROGRESSION SYSTEM: Victory or defeat, the game is not over yet! Unlock new units, each with a unique set of upgrades and load-outs. Unlock new items to bolster your new strategies. Synthetic Domain is a small team of hobbyists with a passion for making games. We are working with limited resources to deliver quality games focusing on polish and execution. We look at indie games, games from the 90s and 00s for our inspiration, hoping to bring some of the spirit of this era to the modern age.",

Prepare yourselves to build, lead, fight, and change the course of history! ROAD REDEMPTION Road Redemption is an action racing game where you lead your motorcycle gang on an epic journey across the country in a brutal driving combat adventure, taking heavy inspiration from series such as Road Rash and Motorstorm. Earn money by completing races, assassinations, robberies, and other challenges in your path. As you collect loot, you'll upgrade your character, your bike, and your weapons. One Life To Live Driving a motorcycle at 100 mph while trying to hit someone with a pipe is dangerous, and death can come quickly. Fortunately, every time you die, all the experience you've collected can be used to upgrade your character, your bike, and your weapons. In the multiplayer splitscreen, 4 friends can work together to let out some road rage in the coop campaign. A Truly Epic Quest Road Redemption takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, ruled by a brutal dictator. Fans of Mad Max will feel right at home here. After years of bloody street warfare, the country's biker gangs have settled into an uneasy truce. This period of peace is interrupted when the leader of the country's richest weapons cartel is assassinated, and a $15,000,000 bounty is put on the mysterious assassin's head. It's up to you and your fellow gang members to chase down the assassin and claim this prize, but you'll have to drive through enemy territory to do so. Every biker in the country wants a piece of that $15,000,000 bounty, and they won't hesitate to take out those who get in their way. Other Features Tons of brutal weapons. This is more Twisted Metal or Burnout than it is Mario Kart 4-player splitscreen co-op. 2-4 player multimonitor co-op. Every player gets his own screen! Massive, expandable skill tree. Rack in the loot to upgrade your character, your bike, and your weapons. A deep motorcycle fighting system with grabs, kicks, counters, critical strikes, and more. Full support for both mouse & keyboard and gamepad control configurations.",

        "description": "Subnautica is an underwater adventure game set on an alien ocean planet. A massive, open world full of wonder and peril awaits you! Dive Into a Vast Underwater World You have crash-landed on an alien ocean world, and the only way to go is down. Subnautica's oceans range from sun drenched shallow coral reefs to treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and bio-luminescent underwater rivers. Manage your oxygen supply as you explore kelp forests, plateaus, reefs, and winding cave systems. The water teems with life: Some of it helpful, much of it harmful. Scavenge, Craft, and Survive After crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft diving gear, lights, habitat modules, and submersibles. Venture deeper and further form to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft more advanced items. Construct Underwater Habitats Build bases on the sea floor. Choose layouts and components, and manage hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as you explore the vast ocean. Unravel the Mystery What happened to this planet? Signs abound that something is not right. What caused you to crash? What is infecting the sea life? Who built the mysterious structures scattered around the ocean? Can you find a way to make it off the planet alive? Disrupt the Food Chain The ocean teems with life: Use the ecosystem to help you. Lure and distract a threatening creature with a fresh fish, or simply swim as fast as you can to avoid gnashing jaws of roaming predators. Handle the Pressure Build a Pressure Re-Active Waterproof Nanosuit, or PRAWN Suit, and explore extreme depth and heat. Modify the suit with mining drills, torpedo launchers, propulsion cannons, grappling hooks and more. Fear the Night As the sun goes down, the predators come out. The ocean is unforgiving of those caught unprepared in the darkness. Areas that are safe to explore during the day become treacherous at night, but also reveal a beauty that those who hide from the darkness will never see. Dive Below the Ocean Floor Cave systems wind below the sea bed, from dark claustrophobic passages to caverns lit by bio-luminescent life and burning-hot lava flows. Explore the world below the ocean floor, but watch your oxygen levels, and take care to avoid the threats lurking in the darkness. About the Development Team Subnautica is being created by Unknown Worlds, a small studio founded by Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire that traces its roots back to the 2003 Half-Life mod Natural Selection. The team is scattered around the globe, from the United States to the United Kingdom, France, the Czech Republic, Russia, Thailand, Australia, and many more places. There is a central office in San Francisco, California that serves as home base for the whole team.

You’ll also be able to fish in a pond or in the open sea, cut trees with your hatchet, build things with your hammer, and use a hoe to help you harvest your island. Koa will need your help. With a basic set of skills, she can acquire new abilities and learn from the world that surrounds her. We want you to feel like you’re growing up with Koa, bonding with her and with all the other people in the archipelago. You’ll be able to sail to new islands and find treasures and other secrets in the middle of the sea with your trusty boat, which you can upgrade with a little effort and time. With new islands come new people. You’ll talk and trade with over twenty characters, each one with their own story and life. They’ll give you quests, hints about the world, or just anecdotes about their experiences and travels. Getting to know them is a significant part of the game, so we put much effort into making them unique and exciting. But not everyone will be friendly. An evil corporation called Elit wants to conquer Mara and exploit the ocean. Napopo is one of their first victims, a strange creature that will seek Koa for help.",

Run through linear levels from point A to B with a double jumping bird while avoiding enemies, collecting stars (if desired), and getting all kinds of little speed boosts along the way. Features: - Simple to understand gameplay: Just run around and jump and you already set to get the highest rankings in each level - A variety of levels with different retro and colorful themes - Cool tunes inspired by late 90s as well as early Y2K styles. - A bird with sunglasses and a backpack! (New) Features (for people who played the earlier stuff): - Toree has two new moves! The player can now use a grounddash in mid air to descend faster and get a speedboost when impacting on the ground, as well as homing in on special stars to get a height and movement boost.​​ - New Looks! Toree Saturns artstyle tries to be a combination of late 90s 3D with some of the more crazy looks of the early Y2K era. It's like a natural evolution of the artstyle of the previous games... I hope.​​ - Controlling Toree got way easier!​ No more Run-Button, meaning players don't have to hold down the right trigger for ages.​ Most actions (except for the trigger for the ground dash) only use the Jump button.​ Ground Dash is performed by the now freed Right Trigger of your controller (LMB if K&M)",
