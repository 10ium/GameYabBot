        "description": "The mean cruel cold blooded tyrant Ceville ruthlessly rules the beautiful kingdom of Faeryanis. Or rather, he used to rule the beautiful kingdom of Faeryanis, until the brave people revolted against his regime and drove him out of the palace. The kindhearted queen Gwendolyn did step up to reign over the land with a council of noble and wise advisors.. It seems that this story could end just like any other fairy tale: \"And they lived happily ever after...\" But no, that's not quite right. Because another evil rises within the land. The treacherous Basilus — counsellor of Gwendolyn and of Ceville before her — plans to take the crown and torture the realm with the help of murderous beasts he has summoned from the planes of eternal darkness. All seems lost! But hope resides with the one most unlikely person imaginable to save the kingdom and restore peace to the realm: Ceville, the realm's former despotic ruler... Ceville The ancient ruler of Faeryanis and spare-time tyrant, is dreaming up evil plans to exact his revenge on his former counsellor and servant Basilus, who betrayed him. Ambrosius The noble and somewhat self-important knight Ambrosius is Ceville's would-be-nemesis. He constantly attempts to capture Ceville — but usually with little success. Will they both team up to fight a greater evil? Lilly The gentle and kind girl Lilly is rather an improbable choice to team up with Ceville. Never the less she helps him to escape for the good of the realm (at least that's what SHE thinks!) This game will give you an impression of what happens, when you mix up the setting and humour of Shrek, Discworld and the Monkey Island series. up to three simultaniously playable characters with weird but loveable personalities bizarre characters from stock-broker dwarves and hippie-elves who populate the fairy-tale realm of Faeryanis various locations all over Faerynis, like the Not-So-Hidden druid circle, the (former) Elven Forest, The Dwarven Mines of Mount Goldmore and more! a variety of puzzles, many of which that can only be solved by teamwork of two (or more) player characters tons of humour",

Note : The game focuses on exploration and slowly increases tension to create a deeper and more meaningful experience. It is supplemented by light, loud and sudden sounds. Take into account that it makes you feel a lot of fear and is a difficult game. Christmas Night is a first person psychological horror game. Environment : The game takes place in a house in a small town in Cordova, Alaska. A 12-year-old little girl lives in this house with her mother. The Plot : The moment the little girl had been waiting for finally came. The tree was decorated, preparations were made and the desired wishes were made. Even though you've been good all year, you're going to have to do more to get the gift you wanted and not be on Santa's spoilers list. - Will tonight go as Vanessa planned? The Christmas Eve she had been waiting impatiently for turned into a disaster for the little girl. - If you want your gift, listen to what Santa says and do it to the letter. - Your mother may have left you alone at home, but the mysteries of Christmas will not leave you alone. Developer's comment about the game : We recommend that people who are afraid of the dark, have a heart condition, and are afraid of being alone should not play alone.

        "description": "The entire world has fallen and the surface has been overrun by a hostile and aggressively-evolving horde of mutants. Well, not entirely. A motley group of persevering preppers are seizing their moment of glory and holding out against the abominable threat lurking right outside the perimeter of their makeshift establishment. Guntouchables is a 1-4 player co-op roguelike doomsday shooter where every second counts. Impeccable teamwork and wise decision-making will be key to beat the overwhelming odds when facing the ever-changing enemies of the wasteland. No one could have foreseen the end of times, but anyone could have prepared for it. You must choose your character and play your part as one of the Guntouchables - a ragtag group of irrepressible survivors who’s been spending years preparing for the direst scenarios imaginable. Now they are facing the disaster of their dreams! Fortune Favors the Bold! Complete mission objectives and collect UpCrates for Cash and Perks that will increase your chances of survival in the wasteland as difficulty gradually escalates. Every second counts, and every reward is associated with a risk. Success must be found in the delicate sweet spot between boldness and greed. Evolving Enemies Between each mission, players must vote between a random selection of mutations that will grant enemies new traits and abilities. Fortunately, this choice will also offer the players immediate or long-term benefits, making the decision less obvious but more critical. Hoard Upgrades Player upgrades are at the heart of the Guntouchables and crucial to help you keep up with the scaling difficulty. Combine common and class-specific perks and abilities to form powerful and creative builds. Mod Your Guns You won't make it long in the apocalypse without the right set of tools. Guntouchables feature a sizable and widely expandable arsenal of high-powered guns. Choose a loadout that fits your style and then mod it with upgrades to your personal preference. A clever combination of perks and gun mods will turn you into an unstoppable mutant killing machine in no time. Open Development Launch will just be the beginning. Guntouchables is designed to be a heavy and easily expandable experience, and any content additions will increase the possible outcomes and combinations exponentially. We want to invite anyone who is interested, to join our community on Discord or follow the game's development on our other channels. We are striving to be as open, fair and transparent as possible about the game's development and launch. We believe this attitude will bring us closer and more in tune with the players, and allow us to make better decisions, and a much more engaging experience, but we ultimately depend on the support from you.",

        "description": "A long-forgotten enemy rises and brings portents of doom – the Demon King is coming, and without a champion to strike him down, the world will surely fall to his corruption. Seek out powerful weapons and artifacts by day, stand against his minions by night, and prepare to be hunted by powerful entities from ages past in this roguelite role-playing game. Every three days, a terrifying new minion of the Demon King begins his hunt, drawn from a pool of over 30 potential bosses. Study each monster’s strengths and unique powers, and adapt your build accordingly. Explore the realm in search of the weapons and equipment best suited to defeat this powerful predator, but be wary of other fell creatures that roam the world by night. With limited time, will you opt to sharpen your blade at hidden ancient forges, pay a high price for rare trinkets from greedy merchants, or seek out mighty armor and magical shields? Choose the tools that work best against the powerful enemy that hunts you today, without sacrificing your preparedness for what comes next, overcoming the guardians of each realm until the Demon King Himself stands before you. Pursue a multitude of strategies and synergies with over 350 items at your disposal to confront the unique challenge of each monstrous boss. When hunted by the Razorclaw Grizzly, whose fierce attacks ignore all armor, how much armor will you sacrifice for equipment that prioritizes maximum health, speed, or damage? The lesser monsters stalking the realms will wage a war of attrition against an unarmored hero, and should the Razorclaw Grizzly be slain, three days may not provide enough time to gather enough armor for the next great foe that hunts you. You may, in place of armor, find several items that enhance your speed and attack strength, allowing you to strike first and hard, vanquishing your enemy swiftly – sometimes before it’s able to strike at all. Then, if you luck upon the Saffron Feather, you’d be able to take advantage of your high speed to help regenerate wounds during battle. But should you find yourself hunted by the Black Knight, who absorbs your attack power as his own, high armor becomes a priority over raw attack strength – with the aid of Razor Scales armor to reflect damage back upon your enemy, and enchanted Ruby Earrings to inflict damage every other turn, the Black Knight would face steady damage without raw attack power to absorb for himself. But if you happen upon a powerful magical weapon, do you dare take it up, knowing it will strengthen the Black Knight for the fight ahead, but come to your aid should you survive it? There are a plethora of options for each threat, with a variety of powerful combinations to be discovered and exploited at your disposal among the countless items, and constant tradeoffs between the near and long-term threats – with limited space in your inventory, you must choose wisely and adapt constantly. He is Coming also features an asynchronous multiplayer mode, Kingmaker – seek out the fallen Demon King’s crown in an ultimate test of your strategies where your champion faces off against the powerful builds of other players. Plan around the equipment and abilities of these would-be heroes in the hunt for the crown, and face a constant onslaught of unique combinations and unforeseeable circumstances – how will you rise above all others? You will face both great victories and noble defeats. Each run will contribute to your progression as you complete over 100 unique challenges that add powerful new artifacts to the pool of items available for future runs – while your first hero may not defeat the Demon King, their efforts will not be in vain. The world descends slowly into chaos as the Demon King grows in strength – the trees wither away, the grass turns to ash, and the bogs turn putrid with the stench of death. Take on the mantle of a hero and prepare yourself – for He is Coming.",

It’s been set in dusty corridors of a mysterious research facility that comes alive and kicking, and it’s up to you whether you blast your way through with a flamethrower or find a way to overcome the traps and puzzles using found objects and environmental features. You know how it is when you come to work in the morning and a strange infection spreads through the ventilation, turning your colleagues into fungal zombies... Classic. The story of the game is inspired by my vocation as a microbiologist (no, The Last of Us wasn’t the inspiration) and contains many references to both current and past aspects of the Institute of Microbiology (MikroBiologický Ústav in Czech) — hence the subtitle Heroes of MBÚ . Since childhood, I wanted to create my own game. This debut is my humble tribute to the legendary games like Abuse , Half-Life and the original Fallout . I built the game on my own engine, in Java, as an amateur enthusiast which took me over eight years. It was a long - but amazing - journey. It allowed me to dive in and take pleasure in full creative freedom. Now! I hope you’ll enjoy as much as I enjoyed creating it!

Help the city survive escalating events like riots, organized crime, terrorist attacks, cataclysms, natural disasters and many more! Danger has escalated Help on a scale bigger than ever before. The sequel of the award-winning 911 Operator lets you act on many, completely different levels - from taking care of a single neighborhood to coordinating several operators’ work in the world’s biggest metropolises. Full 3D visualization will give you the inside view of your units’ actions. Choose from over 100 000 areas, such as districts, municipalities, and tens of thousands of real cities from all over the world. To all units: a storm is coming… Face the dynamic weather, based on authentic, historical data. Watch the incidents change as day or night comes, traffic increases and seasons pass. Watch out for extreme conditions that may lead to cataclysms and natural disasters. Try to tame big wildfires spreading across the map. Weather isn’t your only problem though - be careful when dealing with terrorist attacks and gang wars. 112, what’s your emergency? Take calls from people in various situations, needing emergency services’ help. You never know who’s on the other side of the line - you might hear a frightening murder story, maybe you’ll have to instruct someone on performing CPR, or keep your nerves while encountering an annoying prankster. It’s my job, ma’am... Choose one of the European cities in completely new Career mode and find out if you’ll manage to climb up to the very top of an operator’s career ladder. Follow the commands of your supervisors and see your actions affecting people you’re in charge of or those who need your help. Sometimes your mistakes will only be followed by a reprimanding e-mail, sometimes they’ll influence your own life. You can also play special scenarios in any city in the world, or make your own rules in the Free Game mode. We need backup! Command the best specialists, using technologically advanced equipment and vehicles. Decide what to use - a SWAT team, Search and Rescue helicopter, or maybe riot gear? When your units arrive at the scene, command them in the tactical view that gives you the full image of the situation.

Prepare yourselves to build, lead, fight, and change the course of history! ROAD REDEMPTION Road Redemption is an action racing game where you lead your motorcycle gang on an epic journey across the country in a brutal driving combat adventure, taking heavy inspiration from series such as Road Rash and Motorstorm. Earn money by completing races, assassinations, robberies, and other challenges in your path. As you collect loot, you'll upgrade your character, your bike, and your weapons. One Life To Live Driving a motorcycle at 100 mph while trying to hit someone with a pipe is dangerous, and death can come quickly. Fortunately, every time you die, all the experience you've collected can be used to upgrade your character, your bike, and your weapons. In the multiplayer splitscreen, 4 friends can work together to let out some road rage in the coop campaign. A Truly Epic Quest Road Redemption takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, ruled by a brutal dictator. Fans of Mad Max will feel right at home here. After years of bloody street warfare, the country's biker gangs have settled into an uneasy truce. This period of peace is interrupted when the leader of the country's richest weapons cartel is assassinated, and a $15,000,000 bounty is put on the mysterious assassin's head. It's up to you and your fellow gang members to chase down the assassin and claim this prize, but you'll have to drive through enemy territory to do so. Every biker in the country wants a piece of that $15,000,000 bounty, and they won't hesitate to take out those who get in their way. Other Features Tons of brutal weapons. This is more Twisted Metal or Burnout than it is Mario Kart 4-player splitscreen co-op. 2-4 player multimonitor co-op. Every player gets his own screen! Massive, expandable skill tree. Rack in the loot to upgrade your character, your bike, and your weapons. A deep motorcycle fighting system with grabs, kicks, counters, critical strikes, and more. Full support for both mouse & keyboard and gamepad control configurations.",

Run through linear levels from point A to B with a double jumping bird while avoiding enemies, collecting stars (if desired), and getting all kinds of little speed boosts along the way. Features: - Simple to understand gameplay: Just run around and jump and you already set to get the highest rankings in each level - A variety of levels with different retro and colorful themes - Cool tunes inspired by late 90s as well as early Y2K styles. - A bird with sunglasses and a backpack! (New) Features (for people who played the earlier stuff): - Toree has two new moves! The player can now use a grounddash in mid air to descend faster and get a speedboost when impacting on the ground, as well as homing in on special stars to get a height and movement boost.​​ - New Looks! Toree Saturns artstyle tries to be a combination of late 90s 3D with some of the more crazy looks of the early Y2K era. It's like a natural evolution of the artstyle of the previous games... I hope.​​ - Controlling Toree got way easier!​ No more Run-Button, meaning players don't have to hold down the right trigger for ages.​ Most actions (except for the trigger for the ground dash) only use the Jump button.​ Ground Dash is performed by the now freed Right Trigger of your controller (LMB if K&M)",

While saving the world is definitely an important goal there’s a whole range of other activities to dive into. With the help of a magical amulet bestowed upon you by the Kraken, you can play with time to learn teachers’ and students’ routines, and explore every corner of the campus. Attend a costume party, become a detective, and help the school’s janitor bring down a crime syndicate. Kraken Academy is split into four clubs: Music, Art, Sports and Drama: 🎸 Join the alternative Music Club and complete the school’s edgiest rock band. 🎨 Flex your creative flair in the Art Club and show off your work at an exhibition. 🏅 Compete in challenges to become the ultimate warrior in the Sports Club. 🎭 The Drama Club may be full of snobs, but if you can't beat 'em, join em! Who knows, you may even become a star in their next extravagant play. Lucky for you, your amulet will let you join them all! Kraken Academy is a melting pot of wacky personalities. In the Music Club alone you will meet pretty boy and lead vocalist, Vladimir, who struggles with keeping his hysterical fangirls at bay; ill-tempered bassist, Simona, always seen in her giraffe hoodie, who hates everyone (including you); and Broccoli Girl, the drummer, who just can’t get over her ex.
