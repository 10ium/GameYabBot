Help the city survive escalating events like riots, organized crime, terrorist attacks, cataclysms, natural disasters and many more! Danger has escalated Help on a scale bigger than ever before. The sequel of the award-winning 911 Operator lets you act on many, completely different levels - from taking care of a single neighborhood to coordinating several operators’ work in the world’s biggest metropolises. Full 3D visualization will give you the inside view of your units’ actions.

Watch out for extreme conditions that may lead to cataclysms and natural disasters. Try to tame big wildfires spreading across the map. Weather isn’t your only problem though - be careful when dealing with terrorist attacks and gang wars. 112, what’s your emergency? Take calls from people in various situations, needing emergency services’ help. You never know who’s on the other side of the line - you might hear a frightening murder story, maybe you’ll have to instruct someone on performing CPR, or keep your nerves while encountering an annoying prankster.

Follow the commands of your supervisors and see your actions affecting people you’re in charge of or those who need your help.

        "description": "The game is set in our day and age. You play as our young amnesiac hero, who woke up from a year-long coma into an unknown world. He remembers nothing and recognizes no-one from his former life. What happened to him? That’s for you to find out. The game is populated by a variety of characters, each with their own distinct personality, background and secrets. Special attention and care is put into the quality of the images and animations. GAMEPLAY: More than 2500 images More than 200 animations More than 20 characters Free Roam Many locations to explore in detail Time Cycle Relationship system. A variety of fetishes Task log Phone Achievements Secrets and easter eggs WHAT’S COMING: This is how I want the game to look. It is a Free Roam title, with each character having their own schedule and story. The main storyline develops along with the protagonist's relationship to the main characters: Alexandra, Kate and Elena. The basic outline of these relations is a system of 6 levels, with each increasing level allowing for new interactions in Free Roam. As the main plot develops, the player character will encounter secondary characters (girls). I’ve already written about 10 of these secondary girls, but the idea is to bring this number up into the dozens, with each girl having their own plot and relationship levels (from 0 to 5): each level will bring up hotter and hotter encounters. EARLY ACCESS: “Early access” means that you can start playing right now, but you’ll find that some of the game’s features are still to be fully developed. For example, I’m planning to introduce various mini-games which will help in upgrading the player character and advancing the plot. The game features voice acting, but it’s still a ways to go from the level of professionalism that I’d like for each of the animations. I would also like to introduce skills for the main character which will weigh-in on his interactions and make branched scenes according to each player’s particular dialogue choices. Finally, I want to take the post-processing of images and animations to the next level. For this, I will probably need to get a powerful workstation, in order to produce higher resolution images and 60fps animations: all for the sake of perfection! I also plan to fully develop the plot beats and interactions of supporting characters, but only after the main storyline is finished.",

        "description": "NOTE: Sadly this giveaway is only open to users who can supply Canada or USA addresses. You can be anywhere I guess, but you need to have an address in the States or Canada where we can get the item you win sent to you. This is a direct from dev/pub/store giveaway for FGF. Similar to those we have done before. Massive thanks once again to AVerMedia for supplying the giveaway! <3 Back in January 2024, AVerMedia offered some lovely items to showcase their lineup of capture cards for the year! With the recent launch of Pokémon Legends Z-A, AVM are once again wanting to work on a promotional campaign with FGF! The team have three products to showcase that support the Switch 2, Steam Deck, ROG Ally, Switch 1 and many other mobile platforms . They're even running a big sale event for them on Amazon right now until the 30th! The X'Tra Go (GC515) , which is a dock, 4K60/1080p120 display output and 4K30/1080p120 capture device. The Elite Go (GC313Pro) , which is a brick wall wart-style dock, 4K60 display output and 1080p60 capture device. Then finally the Core Go (GC313) , which is another wall wart-style dock, 4K60 display output and charger, but offers no capture. These are basically hub devices with additional features like video capture (on the first two) added in. Pair any of these with your Switch 2, Switch, Steam Deck, ROG Ally, and plenty of other and you're ready for some great couch gamin fun! To promote AVM and these dock devices, I am happy to announce that they supplied one of each, plus some extra goodies. We will be giving away 1 X'Tra Go (GC515), 1 Elite Go (GC313Pro), 1 Core Go (GC313), 5 AVerMedia XL Gaming Mousepads and 3 AVerMedia Hoodies! A grand total of 11 total winners in this giveaway!

Your task is not just to pick up the calls, but also to react appropriately to the situation – sometimes giving first aid instructions is enough, at other times a police, fire department or paramedics’ intervention is a necessity. Keep in mind, that the person on the other side of the line might turn out to be a dying daughter’s father, an unpredictable terrorist, or just a prankster. Can you handle all of this? PLAY ON ANY CITY IN THE WORLD* Check out thousands of cities from all around the world. The Free Play mode lets you choose a city to play on - the game will download its map, along with real streets, addresses and the emergency infrastructure. You can also try the Career mode, which contains 6 cities with unique events – survive an earthquake in San Francisco and save Washington, D.C. from bomb attacks. MANAGE TEAMS A number of police, fire department and paramedic units are at your disposal. The forces may use a variety of vehicles (from common ambulances to police helicopters), essential equipment (e.g., bulletproof vests, first aid kits and technical tools) and consist of team members with different abilities. Main features: Over 50 recorded dialogues inspired by real calls: serious and dramatic, but sometimes also funny or annoying. Real First Aid instructions. Opportunity to play on any city in the world! 6 selected cities in Career mode, featuring unique calls and events. More than 140 types of reports to encounter. 12 types of emergency vehicles (including helicopters, police cars and motorcycles). *** The game requires Internet connection to download free maps. The offline game is available after downloading the maps.

These include regular balance fixes and improvements to AI, and graphics, as well as updates to environments and the frequent addition of content such as new maps, more weapons, extra vehicles, and a plethora of utility items.

You’ll need to brave environmental dangers and deficiencies (from heat and cold to thirst and starvation), build a shelter, eat (or be eaten), and scavenge materials. Explore the island and its abandoned settlements, mysterious monuments, and the factions that occupy them. But, above all, watch out for other survivors… BUILD Design and build bases to store your loot, defend your territory, and control the resources of the island. Research the tech tree, grow farms, command electricity, and commandeer various forms of transportation to traverse the island. Whatever it takes to get ahead. SURVIVE There are no rules in Rust but the ones you make for yourself. Craft tools, armour, and weapons to defend yourself. Cooperate with friends, make alliances, and build a settlement together.

It’s been set in dusty corridors of a mysterious research facility that comes alive and kicking, and it’s up to you whether you blast your way through with a flamethrower or find a way to overcome the traps and puzzles using found objects and environmental features. You know how it is when you come to work in the morning and a strange infection spreads through the ventilation, turning your colleagues into fungal zombies... Classic. The story of the game is inspired by my vocation as a microbiologist (no, The Last of Us wasn’t the inspiration) and contains many references to both current and past aspects of the Institute of Microbiology (MikroBiologický Ústav in Czech) — hence the subtitle Heroes of MBÚ . Since childhood, I wanted to create my own game. This debut is my humble tribute to the legendary games like Abuse , Half-Life and the original Fallout . I built the game on my own engine, in Java, as an amateur enthusiast which took me over eight years. It was a long - but amazing - journey. It allowed me to dive in and take pleasure in full creative freedom. Now! I hope you’ll enjoy as much as I enjoyed creating it!

        "description": "Hey everyone. We have recently seen some comments coming in about Twitter (X) accounts being banned after participating in giveaways posted to the subreddit that include \"Follow blank Twitter Account\" tasks. This is surely some sort of bot/inauthentic action prevention that is getting real users caught up in it. Affected users should appeal their ban. It obviously isn't the fault of you users and definitely is not meant to happen. Hopefully this is resolvable for anyone affected. - https://help.x.com/en/forms/account-access/appeals/redirect This isn't something completely new or anything. We actually had a thread about this 9 years ago , but that was thought to be in a specific case at that time. The reason for this PSA now is that there have been a couple reports of this stuff lately, like this one and some other(s), which is irregular. It's possible that Twitter are starting to do more of a crackdown on accounts they think are fake in some way. Gleam, a common platform with Twitter tasks, has had a warning on their site for ages about the possibility of getting an account locked , but it is odd that it's happening to multiple people now. Hopefully the accounts can be cleared up without issue. Fingers crossed it isn't wide spread or anything. Twitter accidentally banning people is a bummer, but not super shocking considering their bot prevention efforts. EDIT: I have heard back from Gleam after reaching out. I'll share what they have told me. Thanks to Jessica from Gleam for information. At this time, we're not receiving enough feedback that would suggest any type of uptick in restrictions resulting from normal participation in Gleam campaigns, outside of what you've shared with us. X/Twitter may consider incomplete profiles as \"throwaway\" accounts, so we always recommend having a completed profile, including a profile picture. People shouldn't be restricted when they're completing actions in Gleam competitions, as they are compliant with X/Twitter policies and terms, and we have worked alongside X/Twitter for this to be the case. Some people may have their accounts restricted if they behave in a way that is not compliant with X/Twitter's policies and terms, especially around spam. Or, if they behave in a way that is outside of normal use, like having multiple accounts or posting too often, or not at all except to promote competitions (sweepers). However, these are not exact reasons, and you'd need to contact X/Twitter to find out why. {...} {...} I would recommend users contact us if they feel they have been locked out, specifically because they entered a Gleam campaign. So to recap. Gleam still is compliant with Twitter rules and their API usage terms. Assuming you're following actual basic Twitter tasks offered by Gleam, you should be clear. Your account could end up appearing to be a \"fake\" one though to Twitter depending on your overall activity. As of right now though, Gleam hasn't received enough reports of issues with Twitter tasks to take any action(s). Since many have reported issues hearing back from Twitter support to get unbanned, you can reach out to Gleam support about it for more help. - https://gleam.io/contact Note: This is specifically about Gleam usage and bans from Twitter. If you were working with tasks on other platforms (for example Givee) you might need to reach out to them somehow and see if they have a contact to Twitter about these unban requests for valid usage not being taken. submitted by /u/StOoPiD_U [link] [comments]",

        "description": "Zeno Clash is an action/fighting game set in a punk fantasy world. The game is played from a first person perspective and the combat is generally up close and brutal. Experience a deep storyline set in a fantastic world. Play the role of Ghat, a man banished by his own brothers and forced to begin a desperate journey past the forbidden desert and to the end of the world. Nominated in 'Excellence in Visual Art' at the Independent Games Festival, the original visuals, which make full use of the Source engine features, breathe new air in the fantasy game genre. The new close combat mechanics are also a deviation from traditional action in the first-person genre that will feel fresh for new and veteran players. Engaging melee combat in first person The new melee combat system allows players to perform a variety of movements like deflect & elude combos, knockback finisher punches and punishing grab attacks. Learn new attacks as the game progresses and confronts you with more formidable foes. Fantastic visuals powered by the Source engine Players will be immersed in a fantastic world, beautiful and disturbing at the same time. The unprecedented art style brings a fresh new approach to the first person genre. The surreal environments and characters will keep players wanting to discover more. Survival mode challenges Jump right into the action in engaging unlockable \"tower challenges\". The player must overcome enemy waves to progress through the tower levels. The game will rate the player in different categories like speed and performance. A leaderboards system will rank you against your friends, so the challenge never ends. Deep storyline Players will play the role of Ghat; the son of a impressive hermaphrodite creature called Father-Mother, whose children form the most powerful clan in the city of Halstedom. Ghat must escape from his family and start an incredible journey with his female companion Deadra, who will aid him in the dangerous lands of Zenozoik. Bizarre weapons The game features an unusual arsenal of eccentric weapons that are built from scraps and junk. Hammers and clubs will be the most effective when fighting heavy characters that can only be brought down with extreme force. The Zeno Clash Model Pack for Garry's Mod The pack includes 70 models with the characters and creatures to be used with the popular Source engine mod Garry's Mod. \"This is a great addition to the existing library of assets and we really hope the fans will enjoy the content and start developing their own Zeno Clash inspired videos, screens or machinima.\" says Andres Bordeu from ACE Team. Zeno Clash owners can download the free DLC from the Tools tab in their Steam client.",

        "description": "Explore, adapt, and survive in Undawn, a free-to-play open-world survival RPG for mobile and PC developed by LightSpeed Studios and published by Level Infinite. Embark on an adventure with other survivors four years after a worldwide disaster where hordes of infected roam a shattered world. Undawn combines PvP and PvE modes as players fend off dual threats of the infected and other humans as they fight to survive in this apocalyptic wasteland. SURVIVE YOUR WAY Become the ultimate endurance expert. Protect your home, allies, and what's left of humanity against overwhelming odds. The seamless open world of Undawn is filled with realistic details, made using Unreal Engine 4. In this world, players must brave rain, heat, snow, and storms and track their character’s survival indicators such as Hunger, Body Type, Vigor, Health, Hydration, and even Mood. Changes in the environment will also affect these survival indicators in real time. Players can customize their character’s appearance and outfits, interact with other players to trade weapons and resources, and fight to protect their resources. EXPLORE AN EXPANSIVE OPEN WORLD Dare to explore a huge seamless map filled with distinct terrains such as plains, mines, deserts, swamps, and abandoned cities, each with diverse ecosystems filled with animals, plants, and weather systems. While exploring the remains of society, players can discover special game modes through interactive environmental items, embattled strongholds, and dynamic weekly events and side quests. Players must bravely explore the continent, learning to craft tools, master different weapons, build a shelter, search for survival buddies, and do everything they can to stay alive. The infected can appear anytime as you are exploring and are a huge threat to your continued existence! REBUILD THE RUINS Rebuild a new home and a new civilization with the wisdom of humanity – build your base of operations to your specifications and survive on your own or with your friends inside a massive 1-acre manor. The robust free building system allows more than 1,000 types and styles of furniture and structures, as well as ways to grow your settlement over time. Search for other outposts to form alliances and fight back against the infected together to keep your home safe. SQUAD UP TO SURVIVE Set yourself up for success as a member of the storied Raven Squad. The raven is traditionally a symbol of death and bad omens but can also stand for prophecy and insight. Your squad lives between these two meanings each day and night. In the new world, four years after the disaster, survivors have split into different factions, each with their own rules of survival. Face off against members of the Clowns, Eagles, Night Owls, and Reivers for territory, and get through some darkest nights for the next sunrise. ARM YOURSELF FOR THE APOCALYPSE Protect your home, allies, and what's left of humanity against all odds with a wide variety of weapons and armor for you and your homebase. Beyond the standard weapons, players can also use other tactical gear including melee weapons, drones, decoy bombs, auto turrets and more to level the playing field. Choose from more than 50 types of vehicles for quick supply runs and to conquer new lands, while utilizing tailored-to-environment tactics to dominate the various infected zones found throughout the game.",

        "description": "As an avid Sudoku enthusiast, I could not find a satisfying Sudoku game on Steam, so I started learning the programming language, and based on my understanding of Sudoku and the experience of other games of the same type, I created a new Sudoku game - Meta Sudoku in a few weeks, whether you are a novice or an experienced Sudoku master, this game will meet your gaming needs. Meta Sudoku is a minimalist puzzle game, your only goal is to fill in the nine numbers 1, 2, 3, and up to 9 in the spaces in a 9 X 9 square according to the numbers given by the system, so that each row, column, and every 3 X 3 palace contains the nine numbers 1~9, and there are no repetitions and omissions. The rules of the game are simple, but finding all the numbers that fit the rules can be challenging. Meta Sudoku is great for exercising your brain while relaxing at leisure, and it provides players with the most comfortable gaming experience. There are four modes of Meta Sudoku: 1. Classic Mode: This mode contains six increasing difficulty levels, namely easy, medium, advanced, difficult, expert, master, and each difficulty level contains 40 levels. 2. Pack mode: This mode contains three increasing difficulty levels, namely Pack I., Pack II., and Pack III., each difficulty level contains 25 levels. Compared to the classic mode, the levels in this mode are more beautiful, and the distribution of the system numbers is like a mysterious geometric pattern. 3. Endless mode: This mode still contains six increasing difficulty levels, namely easy, medium, advanced, difficult, expert, master, each time you enter a new level, the system will carefully select a level that belongs to you. 4. Ultimate Mode: This mode contains only three levels. These levels are definitely a real test, they were designed by world-class masters themselves, and considering their difficulty, I designed them to the end. I strongly discourage challenging these levels at the beginning, you can try them again once you are familiar with the game mechanics. After completing these levels, you will have a full sense of accomplishment. Game Features: Game: 1. Minimalist interface to provide you with the most comfortable visuals, allowing you to focus on the fun of the game 2. There are multiple color themes in the game for you to choose and replace to avoid aesthetic fatigue as much as possible 3. Several quiet, comfortable and relaxing ambient music to relieve your brain fatigue 4. Multiple mechanisms reduce the likelihood of optical illusions 5. Support the operation of withdrawal and recovery, you have the opportunity to repent. 6. Support the hint function of remaining numbers to save game time as much as possible 7. Support shortcut keys, which improves the convenience and flexibility of operation, allowing you to pay more attention to the logic of the number itself 8. Exiting halfway will save time and progress (if you don't want to use this function, you can change it in the setting interface) 9. Support English, Russian, Chinese, French and other languages [/i][/list] Steam: 1. Support Steam cloud save 2. There are some simple style achievements that you need to complete 3. Ultra-low pricing with frequent discounts 4. In the future, gradually add trading cards, Steam badges and other functions [/i][/list] -------------------------------------------------------- The audio in the game is all from royalty-free files provided by excellent sites like freeSound. If you encounter any problems with the game, or want to give me some comments and suggestions, or even just want to say hello, you can contact me through the Steam community or email. I will try to find time to communicate with you as pleasantly as possible. I apologize if I didn't respond to your message in a timely manner, probably due to negligence or busy work. I will try to avoid this from happening. Your support and input are crucial to me, and I will continue to improve the game to ensure it performs at its best in all aspects. Finally, thank you again for taking the time to read this article, please enjoy your Sudoku journey to the fullest! ——————Matrix Science This page is translated using ChatGPT, if you find any misleading content, false transmission, or culturally sensitive issues during use, please contact me to update.
