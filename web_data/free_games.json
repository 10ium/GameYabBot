Prepare yourselves to build, lead, fight, and change the course of history! ROAD REDEMPTION Road Redemption is an action racing game where you lead your motorcycle gang on an epic journey across the country in a brutal driving combat adventure, taking heavy inspiration from series such as Road Rash and Motorstorm. Earn money by completing races, assassinations, robberies, and other challenges in your path. As you collect loot, you'll upgrade your character, your bike, and your weapons. One Life To Live Driving a motorcycle at 100 mph while trying to hit someone with a pipe is dangerous, and death can come quickly. Fortunately, every time you die, all the experience you've collected can be used to upgrade your character, your bike, and your weapons. In the multiplayer splitscreen, 4 friends can work together to let out some road rage in the coop campaign. A Truly Epic Quest Road Redemption takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, ruled by a brutal dictator. Fans of Mad Max will feel right at home here. After years of bloody street warfare, the country's biker gangs have settled into an uneasy truce. This period of peace is interrupted when the leader of the country's richest weapons cartel is assassinated, and a $15,000,000 bounty is put on the mysterious assassin's head. It's up to you and your fellow gang members to chase down the assassin and claim this prize, but you'll have to drive through enemy territory to do so. Every biker in the country wants a piece of that $15,000,000 bounty, and they won't hesitate to take out those who get in their way. Other Features Tons of brutal weapons. This is more Twisted Metal or Burnout than it is Mario Kart 4-player splitscreen co-op. 2-4 player multimonitor co-op. Every player gets his own screen! Massive, expandable skill tree. Rack in the loot to upgrade your character, your bike, and your weapons. A deep motorcycle fighting system with grabs, kicks, counters, critical strikes, and more.

Cultural Localization: Western-friendly UI and design. Developer’s Letter Dear Adventurers, Welcome to the enchanting world of Goddess of Fate: Waifus RPG! I’m the lead developer of this passion project, and on behalf of our entire team, I’m thrilled to share the story behind this game, our creative vision, and the heartfelt dedication we’ve poured into crafting a universe where 100+ goddesses await your command. This isn’t just a game for us—it’s a love letter to anime fans, strategy enthusiasts, and collectors who dream of forging bonds with vibrant characters in a dynamic, immersive world. Our goal was to create an experience that blends tactical depth, emotional storytelling, and breathtaking artistry, all while fostering a player-first community. Let’s dive into the journey of Goddess of Fate and why we believe it’s a game that will captivate your heart and mind. The Genesis: A Dream of Gods and Bonds The idea for Goddess of Fate was born from our team’s shared love for anime, mythology, and strategic gaming. We were inspired by the rich tapestry of global mythologies, where gods and goddesses embody the essence of human emotions, aspirations, and conflicts. magic,hellcard,manor,yakuza,marvel,mage,wallpaper,lego,bleach,victoria,shogun,blue,archive, diablo,infinity,atelier,repo,pretty,derby,sims,kingdom,grounded,ground,tale,tales,nba,ea, human,siege,peak,dcs,cod,destiny,ready,mecha,stellar,blade,wuthering,waves,chaos,child, avatar,rust,2024,f1,Microsoft,summer,winter,snowbreak,genshin,honkai,marvel,final,fantasy, persona,dragon,Nikki,rdr,hoi,ets,dbd,diablo,banana,wuchang,exilium,frontline,reverse,apex,2077,gta, baldur,lords,jurassic,cities,kings,clair,crusader,black,fallout,pubg,dota,cs,cs2,hades,naraka,bloons,worlds,king,disney,stellaris, fgo,. From the fiery determination of a war goddess to the serene wisdom of a celestial deity, we wanted to bring these archetypes to life as unique, relatable characters—waifus with depth, personality, and stories that resonate. Our vision was clear: create a game that celebrates the diversity of these goddesses while offering players a chance to form meaningful connections with them through gameplay and narrative. Anime has always been a medium that transcends borders, blending stunning visuals with compelling storytelling. We wanted Goddess of Fate to capture that magic, combining the charm of anime-style characters with the strategic depth of card-based RPGs. But we didn’t stop there. We sought to push boundaries by integrating dynamic Live2D visuals, a robust affinity system, and a tactical combat framework that rewards creativity and planning. Our mission was to craft an experience that feels alive, where every goddess is more than a card—she’s a companion on your legendary journey. Crafting the Goddesses: Art, Voice, and Soul At the heart of Goddess of Fate are its 100+ goddesses, each a unique blend of mythology and anime flair. From the outset, we knew that the characters would be the soul of the game. Our art team worked tirelessly to bring these goddesses to life using Live2D technology, which allows for fluid, dynamic animations that make every character feel vibrant and responsive. Whether it’s the flutter of a goddess’s hair in the wind or the subtle shift in her expression during a heartfelt moment, these details create a sense of intimacy and immersion. For special goddesses, we introduced interactive touch reaction skins, allowing players to engage with their favorite characters in a playful, personalized way. Sound design was equally critical. We partnered with renowned Japanese voice actors, including talents like 井ノ上奈々 and 優木かな, to give each goddess a distinct voice that reflects her personality. From the commanding tone of a warrior goddess to the soft, teasing lilt of a mischievous spirit, every line was recorded to enhance the emotional depth of the characters. The voice library, unlocked through our dating-sim-style affinity system, lets players discover new dialogue as they build relationships with their goddesses. This system isn’t just a feature—it’s a way to make every interaction feel personal, as if these characters are truly growing alongside you. A World of Stories: Epic and Intimate The narrative of Goddess of Fate is designed to be both grand and personal. The main storyline follows your journey as a summoner tasked with uniting the goddesses to restore balance to a fractured world. This epic tale is filled with twists, betrayals, and moments of triumph, drawing inspiration from classic anime tropes and mythological sagas. But what sets our story apart is its depth and variety. Beyond the main plot, each goddess has her own “invitation story,” a personal narrative that delves into her origins, dreams, and struggles. These stories are unlocked through gameplay and affinity progression, offering players a chance to connect with their favorite characters on a deeper level. Additionally, we introduced “trial stories” that challenge players to uncover hidden lore and earn exclusive rewards. These bite-sized narratives add layers to the game’s universe, revealing the interconnected fates of the goddesses and the world they inhabit. Whether it’s a tale of a celestial goddess’s sacrifice or a mischievous fox spirit’s redemption, these stories are crafted to evoke emotion and spark curiosity. Our writers worked closely with cultural consultants to ensure that the mythological inspirations—spanning Eastern and Western traditions—are respectful and authentic, while still infused with the playful energy of anime storytelling. Tactical Combat: Strategy Meets Spectacle Combat in Goddess of Fate is where strategy and spectacle collide. Our 6v6 tactical battle system is built around a 2×3 grid, where positioning is as critical as team composition. Placing a goddess in the front row might maximize her offensive potential but expose her to greater risk, while a back-row placement could enhance her support abilities but limit her impact. This system demands careful planning, as every decision—from unit placement to skill selection—can turn the tide of battle. To deepen the strategic experience, we designed a robust synergy system that rewards creative team-building. Mixing and matching goddesses from different races—such as celestial, demonic, or elemental—unlocks exclusive team effects that enhance performance. For example, pairing a fire goddess with a wind spirit might trigger a “Blazing Tempest” synergy, boosting attack speed and critical damage. These synergies encourage experimentation, ensuring that no two players’ squads feel the same. Add to this our dynamic skill combos and flashy special effects, and every battle becomes a visual and tactical feast. Player-First Philosophy: Accessibility and Fairness One of our core principles is ensuring that Goddess of Fate is welcoming to all players, regardless of whether they choose to spend money. We’ve designed a player-first economy that prioritizes accessibility and fairness. Our gacha system is transparent, with high SSR rates and guaranteed banners to give players a fair shot at their favorite goddesses. In-game events offer ample opportunities to earn free base characters, making it easy for collectors to build their dream roster without breaking the bank. Most importantly, there are no paywalls—every piece of story content and PvP reward is fully accessible to free-to-play players. This approach has resonated with our community, as evidenced by our 92% 7-day retention rate, far surpassing the industry average of 62%. We’re also proud to have a 25% female player base, the highest in the strategic card game genre, reflecting our commitment to creating a game that appeals to a diverse audience.These numbers aren’t just stats—they’re a testament to the trust and enthusiasm our players have shown us, and we’re dedicated to maintaining that trust through ongoing updates and fair practices. A Global Experience: Cross-Platform and Localization We designed Goddess of Fate to be a truly global game. With seamless cross-platform support, players can sync their progress between mobile and PC, enjoying buttery-smooth gameplay at up to 140 FPS on desktop. This flexibility ensures that whether you’re on the go or at home, your journey with the goddesses is always within reach. Our localization team worked diligently to create a Western-friendly UI and design, ensuring that cultural nuances are preserved while making the game accessible to players worldwide. From intuitive menus to clear tutorials, we’ve strived to make Goddess of Fate a welcoming experience for both seasoned anime fans and newcomers. Our Commitment: Building a Community with You Creating Goddess of Fate has been a labor of love, but we know that a game’s true potential is realized through its community. We’re committed to listening to your feedback, whether it’s about balancing combat, adding new goddesses, or refining story content. Our roadmap includes regular updates with fresh characters, events, and story arcs, ensuring that the game evolves alongside our players. We’ve already seen the incredible creativity of our community, from fan art of the goddesses to strategic guides shared on social platforms like X. Your passion inspires us, and we can’t wait to see how you shape this world. We also want to foster an inclusive community where players of all backgrounds feel valued. Whether you’re a collector chasing every goddess, a tactician dominating PvP, or a story enthusiast diving into the lore, Goddess of Fate is your game. Join our official community channels to share your strategies, favorite moments, or even suggestions for new goddesses—we’re all ears! Looking Ahead: A Legendary Journey Continues As we look to the future, we’re excited to expand the world of Goddess of Fate. New goddesses, cross-over events, and deeper storylines are already in the works, alongside quality-of-life improvements based on player feedback. We’re exploring ways to enhance the affinity system, perhaps by adding new interaction mechanics or exclusive rewards for maxed-out relationships. We’re also considering seasonal PvP leagues and global tournaments to give competitive players a chance to shine. Final Words: Your Adventure Awaits Goddess of Fate: Waifus RPG is more than a game—it’s a celebration of anime, mythology, and the bonds that unite us. With 100+ goddesses, dynamic Live2D visuals, tactical combat, and a player-first economy, we’ve crafted a world where every player can find their place.

        "description": "This hysterical, story-rich 3D adventure game is all about player choice and partying the way you want. House Party's unique AI and scripting system allows the game to shape and mold its content around your choices. You'll see something new or different each time you play. To date, there are hundreds of different stories, side-quests, and narratives, and thousands of branching stories and dynamic elements. Content is being added regularly, so it just keeps getting bigger and better! Each new game starts at the door as a blank canvas for your decisions. One big house, packed with choices Sweet news! Your buddy Derek invited you to a rager at Madison's house. Surrounded by a group of eccentric partygoers, you must navigate your way through the night - no matter how wild it gets! Step into a sandbox adventure party game where even your simplest choices can impact the game in a magnificent way. Explore thousands of unique branching narratives with fifteen distinct NPCs that react based on your every remark and action, paving the way for tons of hours of unpredictable and hilarious entertainment. House Party’s gameplay starts with the conversations and grows with the decisions made along the way. With no true ending but dozens of stories to navigate, the night is what you make it. Discover Items & Uncover Wild Interactions Explore a two-story house jam-packed with hundreds of items to discover, where every object has a purpose and some can be used in a variety of ways. Change the party's music with the mp3 player, invite a surprise guest over with the laptop, enjoy as many drinks as you can (without getting caught), and... well, we'll leave the most exciting surprises up to you to uncover. Show items to NPCs and they may react with varying dialogue or relationship fluctuations. Most of these hidden objects are vital for completing an NPC's personal storyline and winning their approval. Sometimes you don’t even need any items to cause a ruckus. Play your cards right and maybe you can win them over with your charm alone. NPCs (Not-Boring Party Comrades) You don't have to thank us, but we invited fifteen of our craziest and funniest acquaintances! A new-to-town sorority girl willing to do crazy things to fit in, the most brahsome brah around, a wild mud-wrestling southern belle, a freakishly buff straight-edge dude hawk-eyeing all the booze, and many more hilarious and unique personalities await. Listen closely and the characters will chat about your actions, conversations, and choices, and also provide hints and insights into cracking their stories open. Throughout the night, you may overhear information about their backstories or catch them gossiping about other guests at the party. Every NPC has favorite bands, personal beliefs, friends and enemies, and party goals for the night. Fully-voiced by amazingly talented voice actors and actresses, the partygoers feel vibrant and alive from the moment you set foot through the door. With fifteen of the most interesting, reactive, and hysterical NPC partygoers to ever exist and a rapidly growing roster, there is always plenty of social variety around the house. All of them have inner motivations and strong personal opinions, making them fun to make various choices around and amusing to see interact with one another! Make Friends, Enemies... or More? As you navigate the party, your words and actions will dictate whether each NPC digs your vibe or is seconds away from knocking your lights out. One bad decision might get you beaten to a pulp, while a good choice might result in making an ally that will have your back for the rest of the night. Every response you choose when speaking to an NPC changes how they feel about you. Keep an eye on your social gauges and watch your gameplay impact whether an NPC is crushing on you, feels so-so about you, sees you as a good friend, or hates your guts. Relationship values, good or bad, may open new doors. And, whether you're into guy love or girl love, it's possible to win most characters' hearts for steamy romantic fun at this party! NPCs will respond differently whether they like you, love you, or hate you, unlocking or blocking off potential party choices and unique interactions. They also see what you do and hear what you say, so be careful because one small choice can change everything. Interact With Celebrity Guests Ever heard of the Game Grumps? Make the right choices and you may find Dan and Arin landing unexpectedly in the middle of the house party! Explore their unique storyline, watch them hilariously navigate the festivities, and choose from one of the multiple paths to help them get back to their show! Looking for a hot Spanish tutor to hop in and shake things up? Your decisions could make Lety Does Stuff come knocking on the front door. Explore her wild and crazy side story if you want a real taste of adventure! As one of the only indie studios to ever integrate real-life celebrities into a video game, it has been a ton of fun connecting the guests to the story and welcoming the iconic humor and personalities of Dan, Arin, and Lety into the party. This fall, Doja Cat joins the cast in an expansive all-new optional DLC story! We're excited to welcome the AMA-winning and Grammy-nominated music star into the game and can't wait for Doja Cat's character to ramp up the party even more! Keep an eye out, because there may be more exciting guests on the way!",

        "description": "The Story: Long ago, the kingdom prospered, surrounded by vast forests, towering mountains, and calm seas. The castle stood proudly over the town, and families lived in peace… until one fateful night, when Death itself rode through the gates on a black horse. It moved silently through the streets, and everything in its wake fell to ruin. Fire, plague, and agony followed. Bodies filled the streets, cries faded into silence, and a terrible curse took hold. Since that day, every family has borne the weight of a broken pact. Once every ten years, a chosen one must face the darkness in the hope of breaking the spell. A secret council selects a new knight, forging together a magical six-sided die, each face guiding the fate of a shattered world. Now, the chosen rides toward the ten forbidden dungeons, where shadows cling to the walls… and deep within, monsters await the dice-wielding knight. The Game: DecaDungeons™ is a first-person, turn-based dungeon crawler (DRPG) built entirely with the Smile Game Builder engine. Explore minimalistic yet atmospheric 3D pixel-art-style environments, and fight your way through 10 deadly dungeons to save the kingdom. In this game you will have to fight your way through powerful foes. Between the fighting and the exploration, you can try to find all of the 50 Red Coins hidden across the dungeons... Rare Monsters: Some battles have a 1 in 100 chance of spawning a rare, rainbow-coloured monster that drops huge amounts of EXP and gold. Will you be able to find one? Events!: While exploring, you’ll encounter special events that present short scenarios with three possible outcomes. Your choice can help you… or harm you. Think carefully before acting, luck may not always be on your side! The Council Has Spoken: The kingdom’s fate now lies in the hands of the new dice-wielding knight. Will you conquer the curse, or watch the realm fall into darkness? Key Features: 10 unique, trap-filled dungeons to explore Turn-based first-person combat 50 hidden Red Coins to discover Rare monsters with big EXP and gold rewards Random events with branching outcomes Atmospheric 3D pixel-art style Fully playable with keyboard or controller The game is fully playable with both keyboard and controller, though a controller is strongly recommended for the best experience. DecaDungeons™ was created entirely within Smile Game Builder, without any Unity export or custom programming. It’s a pure showcase of what’s possible in SGB. But keep in mind, the engine has its limits.",

        "description": "A Total War™ Saga: Thrones of Britannia The year is 878 AD, the embattled English king Alfred the Great has mounted a heroic defence at the battle of Edington, and blunted the Viking invasion. Chastened – but not yet broken – the Norse warlords have settled across Britain. For the first time in nearly 80 years, the land is in a fragile state of peace. Throughout this sceptred isle, the kings of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales sense a time of change approaching; a time of opportunity. There will be treaties. There will be war. There will be turns of fortune that become the stuff of legend, in a saga that charts the ascent of one of history’s greatest nations. Kings will rise. One will rule. Thrones of Britannia is a standalone Total War game which will challenge you to re-write a critical moment in history, one that will come to define the future of modern Britain. With ten playable factions, you must build and defend a kingdom to the glory of Anglo-Saxons, Gaelic clans, Welsh tribes or Viking settlers. Forge alliances, manage burgeoning settlements, raise armies and embark on campaigns of conquest across the most detailed Total War map to date. Choose your strategy The Grand Campaign offers multiple routes to a glorious Victory; aggressively expand your territory through force of arms, acquire renown through construction, advanced technology and influence, or complete a series of unique objectives based on your chosen faction’s history. Once completed, steady yourself for a significant late-game challenge and the final, Ultimate victory condition. Explore and conquer the British Isles From the snowy highlands of Scotland to the orchards and meadows of Kent, push back the fog-of-war and unveil the extent of Anglo-Saxon Britain. Varied towns, cities and rural settings inspire a host of different battlefield environments. Experiment with the strategic opportunities afforded by newly capturable minor settlements. Throttle your enemies’ trade routes and coax them out of strong, defensible positions. Viking warlord or Anglo-Saxon king, define their legend Each faction will face a series of unique events and branching dilemmas, often based on authentic historical events and issues of the time. Embark on Viking expeditions, manage the Anglo-Saxon peasant economy, each faction feels and plays differently. Carve out unique roles for your King and Nobles, customise their impact by making meaningful choices about their development and determine how their story will unfold. ‘Classic’ Total War gameplay refined Includes many updates to core Total War mechanics - such as provinces, politics, technologies, recruitment, dilemmas and much more - designed to make your experience more immersive and more meaningful. Playable factions, cultures and kings: Thrones of Britannia will include ten playable factions, from five cultures, with a summary below. The Anglo Saxons – West Seaxe and Mierce When Roman rule in England concluded, new kingdoms of Germanic stock coalesced in the counties now known as Northumbria, Mercia, Wessex, Essex, Sussex, East Anglia and Kent. The peoples of these regions came collectively to be known as the Anglo Saxons. West Seaxe Faction Leader: King Alfred As the dominant Anglo-Saxon kingdom of southern England, the forces of West Seaxe – or Wessex in modern English – provided the isle’s primary resistance against the incursions of the Great Heathen Army. From the capital city of Winchester, Wessex conquered lands in Surrey, Sussex, Kent, Essex and even Mercia. Alfred’s dogged defense of the Danish invasion laid the foundations for Wessex to unite England under one ruler for the first time in 927 AD. Mierce Faction Leader: Ceowulf From its capital city of Tamworth, the kings of Mierce – known now as Merica - ruled the area now known as the Midlands. At its height, Mierce stretched from Northumbria in the north of England to Kent, Sussex and Wessex to the south. In 877 AD, the Great Heathen Army seized the eastern part of the kingdom to form the Danelaw, or East Engle. The Gaels – Mide and Circenn Gaelic culture initially developed in Ireland, their society built around a system of clans and chieftains. They raided and traded with Roman settlements, and by 878 AD had expanded from Ireland to inhabit much of Scotland. With the influx of the Vikings, some raiders settled in Gaelic lands, becoming the Norse-Gaels. The Scottish Gaels would absorb the Picts to become the Kingdom of Alba – essentially setting the blueprint for modern Scotland. Mide Faction Leader: King Flann Sinna Mide lies at the heart of Ireland. Not just geographically, but politically, intellectually and spiritually. Many High Kings have risen from Mide, and its current ruler, Flann Sinna, aspires to that title. With many fellow Irish factions nearby, Mide is in a position to potentially bring the disparate clans together, and usher in an era of Irish prosperity. However, threats are never far away… the Vikings of Dyflin have settled to the east, and their power and influence are growing. Will Mide strive to keep the uneasy peace? Unite the clans in a war against these Norse settlers? Or find some other route to supremacy? Circenn Faction Leader: Áed mac Cináeda Circenn was in origin Pictish, but became more heavily influenced by the Gaels and other peoples over time as they were driven away from the relentless Viking raids. 878 AD marked the end of the Viking invasions, but Circenn’s troubles were far from over. While she had a firm hold over the eastern coast of Scotland, many threats still exist – both within and without. Scoan, the capital of Circenn, was once home to the legendary Stone of Destiny, said to bestow divine strength on her people. Where the stone now resides is a mystery, but if clues can be found, surely the Stone’s recovery would be an adventure worth undertaking… The Welsh – Gwined and Strat Clut The Welsh Kingdoms descended from the Celtic Britons who occupied much of the island of Britain from the Iron Age, into and beyond its Romanisation in the First Century. Ironically, the term ‘Welsh’ derives from the Anglo-Saxon term for foreigner, ‘wealas’, which they applied to the native Britons. The Anglo-Saxons flourished and many of the old Brittonic kingdoms began to disappear. Gwined Faction Leader: King Anaraut The people of Gwined have some claim to the title of 'true Britons', having been driven to the far west by invaders who now call themselves ‘English’. Renowned both for their bardic arts and their skill with the longbow, the Welsh of Gwined thrived under the leadership of Rhodri Mawr. Rhodri kept Gwined largely free of Vikings and other invaders while expanding its borders. Now he is gone and his lands are divided. Strat Clut Faction Leader: Run Strat Clut is a kingdom of the Old North that can be traced back to the Fifth Century and the Celtic Britons. The realm was formerly based at the fortress of Alt Clut but driven out by a Viking invasion in 870. The current King Artgal was taken captive and reportedly killed in mysterious circumstances. The kingdom reformed further into the valley of the River Clyde under the leadership of his only son Run. The Great Viking Army – Northymbre and East Engle In 865 AD, Ragnar’s sons led the Great Viking Army and made landfall in East Anglia. Over the next 15 years the Vikings ranged high and low, from Wessex to The Clyde, conquering towns, claiming victories and suffering their share of defeats until the Battle of Edington in 878 AD, where its leader Guthrum met his match in the young King Alfred and his West Saxon army. Bested in the field, his forces retreated in disarray to a nearby fortress. Flush with success, Alfred’s men gave chase and laid siege. After a fortnight of starvation, the invaders surrendered. Under the terms of his capitulation, Guthrum was baptised into Christianity and he and his men were allowed to return to East Anglia and settle – provided they kept Alfred’s peace, of course. Defeated, but never humbled, the Vikings seethe with an all-consuming rage. One does not cage the wolf without consequence… Northymbre Faction Leader: Guthfrid When the Vikings arrived in Northumbria in 867 AD, they took the city of York – or Eoferwic, as was – for their stronghold. And what a bastion it was, with its formidable Roman walls still standing strong 700 years on. King Aelle of Northumbria attempted to wrest the city back from the Danes, but was captured during the attack. In retribution for Aelle’s execution of their father, the sons of Ragnar made an example of him with the horrifying Blood Eagle ritual. Northumbria remained under Viking control and, after the battle of Edington and the subsequent treaty of Wedmore, a portion of the Great Viking Army marched back to Northumbria, to settle under Alfred’s peace. East Engle Faction Leader: Guthrum Forming the bulk of Britannia’s south-easterly coast, East Engle was the staging-point of the Great Viking Army’s invasion, and the region where many of its warriors settled after the Battle of Edington. Under the rule of the Danish leader Guthrum (or Æthelstan, to use his adoptive name by Alfred) it would ultimately come to be known as the Danelaw. Yet still, some fight remains in the Danes of East Engle. One does not shed the mantle of glory and become a landsman overnight. The Viking Sea Kings – Dyflin and Sudreyar After nearly a century of escalating raids, the Vikings left an indelible stamp on Britannia, altering the course of its history forever. Not least of all culturally, as many smaller bands of Vikings had settled around the isles prior to Alfred’s defeat of the Great Viking army. These smaller factions traded an existence of ceaseless conflict for a new life in Britannia, establishing their own petty principalities, intermarrying and ultimately becoming part of the warp-and-woof of Britannic life. This mingling of cultures, so emblematic of British history, helped create the rich melting-pot of attitudes, beliefs and language that has made the isles and their people so unique. Some Vikings never truly settled however; their designs were grander, their hunger for conquest and greatness unquenched. These Sea Kings would continue their bellicose work, heedless of any decree from England’s upstart ruler… Dyflin Faction Leader: Bardr Dyflin was a major port town on the east coast of Ireland, and the site of Britannia’s largest slave market. It was a major site of Viking occupation, and was ruled until 873 by the Viking lord Imar, often associated with Ivar the Boneless, a son of the legendary Viking warlord Ragnar Lothbrok. Viking raiders had wintered there as early as 840 AD, so their association with the region had been a long one, and over time their customs began to take on a more Gaelic flavour as the slow process of integration took its course. By 878 AD however, Imar’s son Bardr was firmly established on the throne. Would this ambitious Viking ruler seek to seal a lasting peace with the surrounding Gaelic factions? Or return to the ways of Ragnar, and pursue a path of bloodshed and domination? It is hard to ignore the calling of one’s warrior-blood… Sudreyar Faction Leader: Eirik To the west of Alba lies Sudreyar, the Kingdom of the Southern Isles. Comprising the southern Hebrides, these scattered islands were sparsely populated and, bearing the full brunt of the Atlantic weather, were not lands suited to the less-hardy. Like much of Britannia, these islands saw increasing Viking contact from the 8th Century. Prior to this period they formed part of the Gaelic kingdom of Dalriada, until they fell under Viking control. Over the next century, Scandinavian occupancy took on a distinctly Gaelic flavour (and vice-versa), particularly after 872 AD when Harald Fairhair became king of Norway, and his former opponents flocked to the area. Materially poor, but offering an excellent base for those of a nautical bent, the isles of Sudreyar are a perfect staging-post for raiders and explorers.",
