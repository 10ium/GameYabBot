        "description": "The Korean War This war is remembered as the first intense conflict of the Cold War, but usually not much more than that. Few know that the conflict’s first year was a very rapid and dynamic Blitkrieg-like struggle, with the North sudden invasion at the beginning of summer 1950 and the counter-offensive from the United Nations in Fall and early Winter, followed by the intense counter-offensive led by Communist China in winter and spring of the following year. Then after this active phase, the mobile aspect of the war was obliterated in memories by months of stagnation and tense struggles alongside a rarely fluctuating line of fortified positions, reminding many of the trench warfare of the Great War. The ‘hot” part of the conflict finally ceased in 1953 with an armistice, but officially the war has not ended. The Scenarios The goal of the game is to recreate the different phases of the war, either in a complete grand campaign covering the whole actual duration, or in shorter scenarios set at different starting points, such as: • Chosin Scenario : a 3-turns scenario on the infamous battles around Chosin reservoir in Winter 1950 • Incheon Scenario : a 4-turns scenario of the landing at Inchon and subsequent liberation of Seoul, Fall 1950 • Pusan Perimeter scenario : a 4-turns scenario covering the final NK attempt to conquer all of Korea, Summer 1950 • Spring Offensive scenario : a 4-turns scenario covering the Chinese offensive against Seoul in 1951. • Invasion of South Korea Campaign : a short 3 months (12 turns) campaign covering the initial North Korean invasion, early Summer 1950 • Naktong Campaign : a short 2 months (9 turns) campaign covering the Battle for the Pusan Perimeter, Summer 1950 • Across the 38th Parallel Campaign : a short 4 months (16 turns) campaign covering the UN counter-offensive, from Fall 1950 • China Enters Campaign : a medium 6 months (25 turns) campaign covering the Chinese intervention from Late 1950 • The 1951 Campaign : a medium 24 months campaign (100 turns) covering the war from Spring 1951. • The 1952 Campaign : a medium 12 months campaign (50 turns) covering the war from Spring 1952. • The Korean War Grand Campaign : the whole war (150 turns), from June 1950 till the end. All turns in the various scenarios and campaigns above represent one week, between 26 June 1950 and 15 May 1953. One player represents the North Korean and Chinese Communist armies, with Soviet backup, and the other plays the United Nations, comprising South Koreans, UNO, Commonwealth and American forces. The Communists have very numerous land forces at the start of the game, and the Chinese reinforcements are impressive, but they are lacking strength in the air (except when the Migs arrive). The South Korean player must first hold desperately against the initial invasion, waiting for American reinforcements to alter the course of events. Their aerial superiority and economic might are important and can compensate for the lower numbers. Scale The game scale is at the regimental level for land units of both sides, with smaller units (e.g. armor bataillons, UN contingents, partisants) beign also present. Air units are in the form of squadrons. Naval units are present, although most are abstracted at Task Force groups levels (as the war at sea was too much one-sided to be of sufficient interest in our game besides logistical and naval support aspects). Other items such as fortifications, minefields, HQ’s, logistical depots or vehicles, or even industrial infrastructures (to cover the strategic warfare aspects) are also present in good numbers. The map covers all of Korea, from the border with China and the Soviet Union till the southern Straits of Korea and Japan. All natural types of terrain of the peninsula are present, as well as a new model of weather system, showing map changes when it rains or snows, and with the relevant impact on military operations. Players and Sides Players will not only enter detailed military operations and battles (both on land and in the air) but also join in the political and diplomatic aspects of the war, with most of those being handled through the play of cards or via the occurrence of events. In the military field, you have to handle troop movements and maneuvers, organization of air, HQ and artillery supports, breathroughs, exploitations, build-up of logistical networks or fortified lines. Strategic bombing of the Communist industrial and transportation base is also present, as well as popular resistance, training of troops, recompletion of forces, management of unit rotation or partisan warfare. As the United Nations, the uncertainty as to when Chinese intervention will occur in the game (an almost certain outcome, but at an unknown date… yet) will be a decisive factor for your military campaign but also for the decisions you can take in politics (shall MacArthur retain command?) or dipliomacy (shall we accept help from Nationalist China?). On the Communist side, the amount and blatancy of Soviet support, as well as Mao’s implication in the conflict are tools at your disposal. Also, the grand campaign offers option to explore various opening moves and states: what-if the North (or the South) was better prepared, or the USAF ready to jump-in, or extensive fortifications built alongside the 38th Parallel. All of this is for you to discover in the most detailed recreation of the Korean War to date. Duration Variable according to scenarios, from a few hours for the shortest scenarios to 100+ hours for the full war. Balance No side is specifically advantaged. Both are playable and enjoyable once you capture the essence of their specific strong points and weaknesses. Detailed scenario information sheets are here to help you get into the game.",

        "description": "Felix The Reaper is a challenging single-player puzzle game . You take on the role as Felix, whose job is to make sure that people die . To do this, Felix must work in the shadows and rearrange faith so that death is always the end result. At its core, the game is about manipulating shadows so that Felix can set up his targets safely covered by the shadows. The core gameplay has a Hitman Go'ish, Monument Valley'ing and Sokoban-like simplicity running through it. There are three rules you have to master to become a successful Reaper: Rule #1: Stick to the shadows Each level is set on a grid-based platform. The squares of the grid are either lit up or in shadow, and Felix has to do his job in the shadows. Rule #2: Control the shadows Felix has the ability to rotate the sun, and move objects, to create new pathways for him to reach his target. Rule #3: Make sure people die The end goal of each level is to set up your targets and have them meet their maker. To add something extra to this core game experience, we wrapped it in deep layers of storytelling, death, dance, art history, love and comedy. That way you get to enjoy a wholesome story world, while boiling your brains on complicatedly straight forward shadow puzzles about Death. Challenging single-player puzzle game . Take on the job as The Reaper and make sure people die . Make sure to stay in the shadows . Light is the domain of life. Not good. Control the shadows to reach your target. Enjoy a framing narrative of dangerous love and peculiar characters. Dance along with Felix to an original soundtrack from 10+ indie music artists. Unlock time trials and hardcore levels for an extra challenge. Felix The Reaper sprang from a fascination with the sprawling, humorous and grotesque art history of Death. Many themes have emerged in the cultural identity of Death, including The Dance of Death or Danse Macabre and Death And The Maiden . We sort of mashed those two themes together in Felix The Reaper. For the character himself and the world around him, the inspiration was more diverse: We took cues from the ancient TV show The Twilight Zon e, medieval painters like Bruegel and Bosch and the cartoon characters of Adventure Time and Hayao Miyazaki . Another important inspiration for Felix The Reaper was the amazing artistic collaborators in the production. We worked with dancers, a long list of music artists and history scholars. The Dance Several dancers contributed to the game's production, and eventually Gunilla Lind and Raphaël Ferdinand Eder-Kastling improvised the final moves that ended up in the game. Here's Gunilla doing a dance move for Felix: And here's Raphael doing another: The Music Of course a game with a dancing protagonist needs great music—why else would he be dancing? We designed the game in a way that lets the music artists be themselves. We wanted them to add to the game through their personal artistic expression, rather than ask them to be what we want them to be. This made for a varied and strange combination of music. But since the gameplay is a non-stressful puzzler, you actually have time to appreciate and enjoy the weirdness while playing. The Art History The idea for the game itself stems from art history. We actually started with The Danse Macabre and Death and The Maiden as a basis, and then asked ourselves: How can we make a game about this? Eventually and through several different prototypes, we ended up here. Alongside the production, a history scholar was diving into the art history of Death across more than 10 centuries for a book manuscript he is working on, and every time he hit upon something interesting he told us, and we tried to put it into the game if it fit. There are five different articles by this historian Søren Hein Rasmussen within the game—you can unlock them as you progress.",

        "description": "END OF THE ROAD Since the premiere, Frostpunk has been enriched with a number of updates. You can enjoy the new Endless Mode (with 3 ways of playing it) that increases the replayability of the game. There is also a new scenario - The Fall of Winterhome , that further expands the game’s universe and lore. And for the dessert, we’ve added things like naming characters and automatons and finally a photo mode . All of this is available for free for all the owners of the game. There are also three expansions, available with the paid Season Pass . At the same time we would like to inform you that we are not planning to create any more content for Frostpunk, as this journey is over for us, but there are more to come in the future, so be sure to keep an eye out for our games. Of course the game will still receive patches and fixes and we’ll provide the technical support. SEASON PASS The Official Season Pass for Frostpunk is out and complete! It grants you access to all additional content released for the game since the premiere, including three expansions ( The Last Autumn , On The Edge and The Rifts ), that widely broaden the main story and fill a lot of gaps in the game’s universe. What’s more, when you’re done with the game itself, you’ll be able to unwind while listening to the Digital Soundtrack featuring orchestrated music or learn more about the world with the exclusive Digital Artbook . Not having the game at all? Worry no more, as the Frostpunk: Game of the Year Edition is what you are looking for. It includes the main game, season pass and all exclusive content at a discounted price. ABOUT THE GAME THE CITY MUST SURVIVE Frostpunk, the newest title from the creators of This War of Mine, is a society survival game where heat means life and every decision comes at a price. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive. Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state. What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process? MAKE THE LAW Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there’s no turning back. WEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden. DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills. EXPLORE THE FROSTLAND While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands. PLAY ENDLESSLY Frostpunk Endless Mode grants you unlimited replayability for the game. Play on 8 various maps, with different terrain, weather conditions and challenges to face. We know that different people look for different experiences and that’s why there are 3 modes to play in Endless Mode. Endurance will be an ultimate test to your building, managing and survival skills in the harshest conditions. Builders, where there is no generator available from the start, which creates a different type of challenge. And last but not least, Serenity which is focused on enjoying the art of building the city itself, without unnecessary pressure.",

Such a shame that she ended up in the world of the dead. Now the only way to return home is to get to the Gate to the world of the living, but she will have to go through an island of dungeons filled with the undead. Challenge your fears as an anime coward, that ended up in a western fantasy world. Maria loses mana when she is scared. In this unfamiliar environment, the monsters are too realistic. Get to the treasure or open a shortcut while you still have mana. When mana runs out, Maria will panic and run to safety, and the undead will respawn. Which move will save more mana and health in combat? The game is turn-based, so you have time to think. But the enemies are not stupid, they will pull up Maria and quicky surround her. Maria can cast spells. Her main tool is magic stones. When inserted into a magical wand or sword, the stones let you use new spells.

The game immerses you in a dark world filled with nightmares and monsters, where every action you take matters for survival. In conditions of limited visibility, you’ll have to fight horrors, solve puzzles, and make choices that affect the outcome of the game. A unique feature of the game is the lighting system: your flashlight only illuminates areas where the cursor points, enhancing the atmosphere of unease. Throughout the game, you will need to not only fight monsters but also plan your actions carefully, conserving ammunition and finding shelter, as every resource is crucial. The pixel graphics create a tense atmosphere, and the sound design further amplifies the fear. The game leaves a lasting impression, especially if played in a dark room with headphones.

        "description": "MAINFRAME DEFENDERS Tactical retrofuturistic strategy game. A computer virus has infiltrated the \"Stargazer\" research complex. Most of the robotic units are controlled by the virus. Lead a squad of 4 prototypes on a mission to defend complex mainframe. You'll have to repel assaults, destroy unit fabricators, download valuable data, clear infected nodes, and do more on your way to the deepest parts of the complex. Work with item limitations and drawbacks to build powerful combinations. Destroy your enemies with diverse tactics: overheat them, melt with corrosion, absorb damage, and return fire. But don't rely on a single strategy too much - enemies might have a way to counter it. But above everything else: defend the Mainframe! * RETRO STYLE: Graphics, inspired by 80s terminal PC with hybrid synthwave soundtrack. * DIVERSE TACTICS: Cook enemy robots to death, bury them under your bullets, eliminate with a single powerful shot, or render your opponents useless with debuffs - this game is designed with a lot of viable strategies in mind. * BUILD YOUR SQUAD: Similar to how in card games you have to build your deck, in Mainframe Defenders you have to combine different items with unique abilities, to create an unstoppable squad. Work with item drawbacks or double down on them, creating flawed, yet powerful build! * UNIQUE ENEMIES: Enemy squad won't sit idle, though. Each unit has its own role in the squad and designed to counter certain strategies. Pick your targets wisely, or you will lose. * PROCEDURAL LEVELS: Hand-made rooms are combined with procedural generation to create random levels. Missions have differing objectives, combined with unique mission conditions. Will you accept the challenge or avoid the unknown and risk falling behind? * PROGRESSION SYSTEM: Victory or defeat, the game is not over yet! Unlock new units, each with a unique set of upgrades and load-outs. Unlock new items to bolster your new strategies. Join our Discord to stay informed about updates for Mainframe Defenders . There you can share feedback and suggestions, as well as chat with our team about the next project_",

        "description": "As an avid Sudoku enthusiast, I could not find a satisfying Sudoku game on Steam, so I started learning the programming language, and based on my understanding of Sudoku and the experience of other games of the same type, I created a new Sudoku game - Meta Sudoku in a few weeks, whether you are a novice or an experienced Sudoku master, this game will meet your gaming needs. Meta Sudoku is a minimalist puzzle game, your only goal is to fill in the nine numbers 1, 2, 3, and up to 9 in the spaces in a 9 X 9 square according to the numbers given by the system, so that each row, column, and every 3 X 3 palace contains the nine numbers 1~9, and there are no repetitions and omissions. The rules of the game are simple, but finding all the numbers that fit the rules can be challenging. Meta Sudoku is great for exercising your brain while relaxing at leisure, and it provides players with the most comfortable gaming experience. There are four modes of Meta Sudoku: 1. Classic Mode: This mode contains six increasing difficulty levels, namely easy, medium, advanced, difficult, expert, master, and each difficulty level contains 40 levels. 2. Pack mode: This mode contains three increasing difficulty levels, namely Pack I., Pack II., and Pack III., each difficulty level contains 25 levels. Compared to the classic mode, the levels in this mode are more beautiful, and the distribution of the system numbers is like a mysterious geometric pattern. 3. Endless mode: This mode still contains six increasing difficulty levels, namely easy, medium, advanced, difficult, expert, master, each time you enter a new level, the system will carefully select a level that belongs to you. 4. Ultimate Mode: This mode contains only three levels. These levels are definitely a real test, they were designed by world-class masters themselves, and considering their difficulty, I designed them to the end. I strongly discourage challenging these levels at the beginning, you can try them again once you are familiar with the game mechanics. After completing these levels, you will have a full sense of accomplishment. Game Features: Game: 1. Minimalist interface to provide you with the most comfortable visuals, allowing you to focus on the fun of the game 2. There are multiple color themes in the game for you to choose and replace to avoid aesthetic fatigue as much as possible 3. Several quiet, comfortable and relaxing ambient music to relieve your brain fatigue 4. Multiple mechanisms reduce the likelihood of optical illusions 5. Support the operation of withdrawal and recovery, you have the opportunity to repent. 6. Support the hint function of remaining numbers to save game time as much as possible 7. Support shortcut keys, which improves the convenience and flexibility of operation, allowing you to pay more attention to the logic of the number itself 8. Exiting halfway will save time and progress (if you don't want to use this function, you can change it in the setting interface) 9. Support English, Russian, Chinese, French and other languages [/i][/list] Steam: 1. Support Steam cloud save 2. There are some simple style achievements that you need to complete 3. Ultra-low pricing with frequent discounts 4. In the future, gradually add trading cards, Steam badges and other functions [/i][/list] -------------------------------------------------------- The audio in the game is all from royalty-free files provided by excellent sites like freeSound. If you encounter any problems with the game, or want to give me some comments and suggestions, or even just want to say hello, you can contact me through the Steam community or email. I will try to find time to communicate with you as pleasantly as possible. I apologize if I didn't respond to your message in a timely manner, probably due to negligence or busy work. I will try to avoid this from happening. Your support and input are crucial to me, and I will continue to improve the game to ensure it performs at its best in all aspects. Finally, thank you again for taking the time to read this article, please enjoy your Sudoku journey to the fullest! ——————Matrix Science This page is translated using ChatGPT, if you find any misleading content, false transmission, or culturally sensitive issues during use, please contact me to update.
