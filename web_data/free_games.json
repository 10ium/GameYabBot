Tyre dynamics are first-in-class, utilising an advanced “brush” model that accurately portrays slip angles and models advanced features such as vehicle “flat spots” that you can really feel. For wheel users, the 400Hz physics engine is directly translated into force feedback, delivering a highly detailed and predictable feeling to your steering wheel with presets available directly collaborated on with a number of prominent equipment manufacturers.

DYNAMIC RACING EXPERIENCE Realistic day and night cycles are a key element of this simulation with incredible lighting effects as you race into dusk, through night and again into dawn down the Mulsanne at over 200mph. Le Mans Ultimate uses an advancement in Real Road 2.0 track evolution simulation found uniquely in Studio 397 titles. Like a real race session, the track will begin as a green, relatively gripless circuit at the start of a weekend and rubber in as more cars pass over the racing line – with cars moving the dust, dirt and marbles off-line. Work has been undertaken in several areas, including the dynamic weather effects too, such as rainfall and debris on windscreens and more realistic flow of water and formation of puddles on the circuit. The cars will also change throughout the race, and the build-up of dirt and debris will cover the car – giving it the authentic weathered, endurance look. MULTIPLAYER - COMPETE IN SKILL BASED EVENTS OR MANAGE YOUR OWN SERVER For those looking for the edge of the seat, wheel-to-wheel competition against real-life drivers, the Online function, powered by RaceControl, will be home to that pulsating challenge.

        "description": "From the acclaimed team behind Blasphemous , NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound successfully unites the classic lore and gameplay of the Tecmo-developed (now KOEI TECMO GAMES) NINJA GAIDEN series from the 8-bit era with the depth and intensity of the modern 3D entries. The best of both eras come together to create an epic and thrilling adventure. Our story begins when Ryu Hayabusa journeys to America to honor his father's will. While he is away, the barrier between the human and the demon worlds suddenly shatters, unleashing a terrifying army upon the Hayabusa Village, which now faces an unprecedented threat in Ryu's absence. To stand against this new threat, Kenji Mozu , a young ninja from the Hayabusa Village, rises to the challenge! Trained by Ryu, he fights fiercely but soon finds himself in desperate straits. Forced to tap into forbidden power, Kenji sets aside centuries of animosity and forms an alliance with the sinister Black Spider Clan , convinced that combining their souls and skills is the only way to protect the world out of the Demon Lord's grasp! Combining old-school feeling with modern precision, NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound retains the pick-up-and-play action of the classic titles, while introducing new layers of depth. Alongside the new protagonist, Kenji Mozu, is the skilled assassin Kumori . Take control of these two powerful ninjas simultaneously and unravel their interconnected stories. Use the Ninja Fusion to unleash devastating abilities and obliterate your enemies. NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound features impeccable mechanics that are easy to learn but hard to truly master, challenging the skills of even the most seasoned fans of the NINJA GAIDEN series! Step into a reimagined version of the classic NINJA GAIDEN universe, brought to life through stunning, meticulously crafted visuals. Every enemy is recreated with a level of detail that was once impossible. The brutal, nostalgia-filled aesthetic of NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound pays homage to the past while pushing the boundaries of modern pixel art, making every battle a feast for the eyes. Do you have what it takes to become a true ninja master?",

        "description": "Weird West legends meet eldritch horror in BLOOD WEST , an immersive stealth FPS. Become the Undead Gunslinger, doomed to roam the barren lands until he finds the means to purge their curse and free his soul. No, this isn’t your typical Wild West desperado redemption arc. This is a damnation arc. The Canyons, the Swamp, and the Mountains. Each swarming with abominable monsters and unholy demons, these are open-ended worlds for you to explore freely at your own pace. It will take the player over 20 hours on average to complete all three scenarios, and over 35 if they want to see everything the barren lands have to offer. Blood West is a stealth FPS inspired by the genre classics such as the Thief series (whose fans will be happy to hear the voice of Stephen Russell, the actor voicing the master-thief Garrett, returning here as the protagonist), S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, or - from the contemporary catalog - Hunt: Showdown. The gameplay rewards the careful approach: scouting the area, stalking your enemies, and striking from the shadows. Can you figure out a way to clear a fort full of ghouls and monsters without raising an alarm? The Barren Lands present the player with a nightmarish, twisted vision of the Wild West legends. The curse that has befallen the realm has corrupted every living thing, defiled the land itself, while summoning restless spirits and dark entities. In this mixture of gunslinger pulp and Lovecraftian horror, dark occult magick presents just as much of a threat as sudden lead poisoning. In Blood West you will meet many colorful, yet strangely twisted, fully-voiced NPCs. Just as much prisoners of the Barren Lands as you are, they will sometimes share their unusual stories and send you on various missions. Play nice and they might reward you or become your allies. Cross them and risk their wrath. The game won’t hold your hand. You’ll have to explore the land for yourself (buying a map from a vendor might prove useful!), and figure out your own way to approach quests. As you poke around the three expansive maps, keep an eye out for hidden places and secret stashes. There’s gold in the mountains! Fair warning - it’s probably cursed. If sneaking around isn’t exactly your thing, or you feel that you have a power advantage over your enemies, you can always take the head-on approach and meet your enemies guns blazing. Blood West comes from the creators of the fan-favorite boomer shooter POSTAL: Brain Damaged , so much gratuitous fantasy violence and pixelated blood splatter is to be expected! One man’s hell might be another hoarder’s paradise! From simple one-use items like bandages, through medical tinctures, explosives and incendiaries, straight to arcane artifacts that - once slotted - can change the way you play the game, the Barren Lands are just filled with STUFF. There are tons of useful items to discover, and there’s a special player’s stash crate for all those super-rare potions that you’ll hoard and never use. A gunslinger without a gun would be just a regular slinger. Where’s the fun in that? Blood West makes sure you’ll have plenty of weapons to choose from. Revolvers, rifles, shotguns, carabines - a great variety of firearms, from standard army-issue to those infused with powerful magic, or straight-up possessed. And if you prefer not to cause a ruckus, there’s a wide selection of hand-to-hand combat weapons and archery weapons to pick your favorites from. The RPG-like perk-based progression system in Blood West will allow you to highly customize the gameplay experience to your liking. Become a stealthy hunter, a revolver-fanning gunman or a relentless berserker. You will gain experience and progress through the skill tree, while discovering new artifacts in each of the scenarios that will bestow on you additional abilities. Combining skills and load-out creates more possible playstyles than you’d normally be able to explore in one playthrough. Are you ready to take back the frontier from the dark forces of demonic corruption and earn the right to move on to a better world? The Barren Lands call you, Gunslinger!",

        "description": "Hey r/AppHookup , indie dev here. I built ReDo Loop because my calendar kept filling up with things that were not real events. Changing filters, replacing toothbrushes, haircuts, routine checkups, and similar recurring tasks. Calendars work great for one time, unmissable events, but for recurring life maintenance they always felt like the wrong tool. So ReDo Loop focuses only on recurring tasks you want to offload from your calendar . The feature that ended up mattering most for me is Relaxed repeats . The interval starts after you complete the task . For example, replace a toothbrush every 3 months after it is done, not on a fixed date. It also supports: fixed schedules such as specific dates or weekdays positional rules like first Monday or last weekend daily routines, one time tasks, and simple tracking where you log when something was done Privacy wise, everything is stored locally. No accounts, no ads, no analytics. I am running a New Year lifetime offer on both iOS and Android and would really appreciate feedback from this community: does the recurring model make sense? anything missing or confusing? features you would expect next? Happy to answer questions or take criticism.

        "description": "Defeat an AI in this co-op party game! Deviation Game is a co-op party game for 2-6 players that pits human creativity against AI perception. Your goal: draw secret prompts like \"Flamingo\" in a way humans can understand, but an image recognition AI can't! Up to 6 people can play with one copy If just one person owns the Steam game, everyone can join by watching that player’s screen. Up to 6 players can join for free using their smartphones’ web browsers via a QR code. How to play 1. Join using your own device Using your mobile device, scan the QR or enter the room code at outdraw.ai to transform your device into the game’s controller! 2. The drawer picks a prompt The drawer first picks a secret prompt from categories such as objects, actions or even concepts. 3. Time to deviate! Then they just gotta draw it! But remember, the aim is to trick the AI while making sure your friends still get the picture! 4. Everyone (plus the AI) guesses Once the drawer is done, all the guessers will submit their best guess, including the AI! Choose carefully, you only get one chance! 5. The answer is revealed! If you fail to fool and the AI guesses right, then humans lose! If the AI fails and humans guess right, then humans win! AI to enhance (not replace) creativity By embracing the medium of games, Deviation Game aims to use AI as a collaborative tool that seeks not to replace human creativity but to enhance it. Through the game, players learn to express themselves in new ways to deviate from what the AI has already learned, making for a fun and brain-teasing party experience, where you’ll create things no one has ever seen before! Flipping Alan Turing’s revolutionary 1950 Imitation Game on its head, Deviation Game encourages players to fool the AI instead of the AI trying to fool them. Keeping consent clear At the end of each game, players can consent to their drawing being used to potentially train the AI... or not! Allowing you to decide how the game may evolve. Collection is opt-out by default, and all data without consent will be deleted. By working together, players from around the world can collectively uncover the biases in large AI models by exposing their blind spots in interpreting diverse, culturally specific drawings. Played by humans around the world Deviation Game was initially showcased as an art installation at Civic Creative Base Tokyo in 2023. The work has since been shown in globally renowned exhibitions, such as Ars Electronica, Taipei Digital Art Festival, and Now Play This, engaging audiences of all ages and sparking critical discussions around AI and creativity. About the creators Deviation Game was developed and self-published by a group of good friends consisting mainly of game designer Tomo Kihara and art-design duo Playfool (Daniel Coppen & Saki Maruyama). With a focus on play, their practice centres around designing tools that foster creativity and making artistic interventions that engage with urban space and society. Their previous work How (not) to get hit by a self-driving car received an Honorary Mention in the S+T+ARTS Prize 2024 at Ars Electronica. Deviation Game is their first experience to self-publish an indie game. FAQ Q. How exactly does the AI guess? A: In each round, the AI will return numerous guesses, depending on the number of players in the game. If one of those answers are correct, AI wins! Q: Doesn’t the AI just have access to all the prompt words? Surely it’s cheating! A: Not at all! While some examples are provided to the AI to give it more context, it is freely guessing each answer it submits, which is why sometimes they’re a little off-base. Q: What AI model are you using? A: Throughout Early Access, we are experimenting with various AI models via the service OpenRouter. In the future, we plan to introduce a feature that allows players to choose which AI model to go up against. Q: Does the game’s AI get smarter after each game? A: No, the AI is not learning in real-time. However, custom improvements to the AI can be made with a future update after enough data has been collected to retrain the model. Q: How is our drawing data being collected? A: We only collect drawing data that has been given explicit consent. Collection is opt-out by default, and all data without consent will be deleted.

The physics is powered by a professional physics engine, which ensures realistic ball behavior. Because this is a physics-driven game, you need to use the geometry of the in-game objects to control them. Third person camera view makes the gameplay very unique in the electronic gaming world. At last a game that lets you perform pixel perfect moves. Open yourself to an atmospheric, magic reality, gain access to a new world where your unreal fantasy of becoming a soccer player will come true. Not many aaa titles offer what you will find in this hidden gem, it may be your best choice. This competitive team-based game is a true marvel for real-life soccer fans, offering endless fun. Soccer Online Playing single-player vs bots is so fun, but this is a modern esport game. Play online in the cross-platform multiplayer and play with other humans over the internet (or local network). Exciting and addictive Co-Op/PvP is the strongest element of this indie game. More than soccer Ball 3D has other sports for you to enjoy on-line: Basketball, Handball, Ice Hockey, Racing, Battle Royale and more. In Battle Royale survival is the key. Carefully overwatch the entire battlefield and avoid your opponents at all cost. It is not a shooter, there is no crosshair, the only weapon you have is you). You win this combat only when all your rivals are \"dead\". Use your reflex to win this epic war. The racing mode is like a kart racer, but with discs. During the race you drive using your mouse and keyboard as a controller. In Hockey mode you play with a puck. Ball 3D is a multi-sport simulation game available on laptop/desktop PC (Windows), Mac/Macbook (MacOS) and Steam Deck (Linux). Absolutely unique soccer sim game for casual, hardcore and pro players, where your realtime reaction skills matter. It mixes arcade gameplay with strategy. Fast-paced, easy to play, hard to master e-sport game with creative mechanics. Great to play in 2025 and even in 2026. It may be a light, relaxing and cozy experience. Unlike many RPG games where you level up your character, here your quest is to improve yourself. Whether you prefer golf, tennis, pool, baseball, cricket, volleyball or any other olympic sport, you will still like Ball 3D. Teams Building your own team is half of the success. Choose a name/tag (FC The Best, AS Best Players, EAS-Vampires, Foot Monsters (FM), Greatest Among Many (GAM), FRE or any other) then invite your friends to join the party and become a real team coach/manager. Be ready to compete in global leagues, cups and tournaments. Wouldn't it be nice to join the elite and win the Ball 3D World Cup Grand Final? Reach the peak and become a God, a living legend, the undisputed best Ball 3D player on the planet earth (the GOAT). Meet new friends, write your story and fulfill your American dream! If you lose, challenge your opponents to a rematch. Invite 1, 2 or 5 friends, 6, 7, 10. Not enough? How about 25, 26 or even more. Cooperation is the secret formula. Your team is hollow without it. Try to play positional attacks or it may defend the goal like a tank, lock the penalty area, turn it into a fortress and try counter attacks. Parking a bus in the goal is a sensible tactic too. Picking the best tactic for your team is like solving a puzzle, use your head and logic. Stealing tactics from your opponents is not theft. It is your role to decide if you want to play with one striker or with two, with three defenders or with four. You may try accurate short passes to gain space or full power flat strikes. Try all possible ideas and alternatives or your team will fall. Welcome new players! Simple tutorial will teach you how to play. It will help you massively to improve during the humble beginnings of your career. It is like a sandbox that lets you practice your moves and tricks. Multiplayer The game offers very advanced and optimized network code, including client side prediction anti-lag system and great dedicated servers in various regions that offer low ping. It is one of the most dynamic highest-rated coop soccer games. If you like multiplayer or mmo games you will love it. Ball 3D is mainly not a singleplayer offline PvE game, but you may decide that it is too early to play with real people and prefer to try your 1st game solo vs bots (AI). Man of the match The name of the best player will be featured and shown on the board as the man (woman) of the match. Put your name there and become popular! It tastes really wonderful to reach the apex and become the hero of the match. Replays Replays (demos) will help you craft your soccer skills into an art. Watch the matches from various cameras, including: TV, Action, Top Down, Auto and several others or from the 3rd person perspective. Remember to record replays and save your \"wow\" goals for later. Soccer variations Try modes like: Darts, Ping Pong and others. Ball 3D is a super fun, rich and deep co-operative game not similar to any other. Different environments Play on the grass, darker grass, dried grass, sand (desert), snow, concrete or rust-colored gravel. Play during the sunny summer, cold snowy winter, rainy autumn or green spring. Do you prefer the daylight or the dark night? Clean hot sky, clouds, wind or maybe a rain?

Even though the above thread mentions that you can buy games for free with this $3 coupon, and some other possible coupons as part of this welcome bonus package going on on Stove, users seem to be trying to share the individual game(s). This, added with the Welcome Pack that seems to have been around for a while, is being shared again. If you create an account for Stove, you get given a coupon voucher that you can apply to orders. New users currently get a 50% off coupon, and a $5 coupon. You can use both of these for orders (at the same time too). The welcome bonus is not new, but it's possible there have been changes with time. https://event.onstove.com/en/welcome https://i.imgur.com/suMRKXk.png Thanks to /u/Saulios for the image. Anyway, with this coupon you can claim a variety of games for free. /u/adamroadmusic put together this list , and /u/SteveLosive shared these , /u/mahadev-1 found Ghostrunner and /u/BeatTheMeatTwice shared that they got Detroit Become Human and Heavy Rain . So, stack up some coupon(s) and snag some stuff on Stove! Feel free to construct a list here if you wish, but please stop sharing single games individually with the coupon(s).

        "description": "RimWorld is a sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller. Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune. You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world. Manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, illnesses and addictions. Build in the forest, desert, jungle, tundra, and more. Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses. Replace wounded limbs and organs with prosthetics, bionics, or biological parts harvested from others. Fight pirates, tribes, mad animals, giant insects and ancient killing machines. Craft structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, and futuristic materials. Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts. Trade with passing ships and caravans. Form caravans to complete quests, trade, attack other factions, or migrate your whole colony. Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires. Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery. Discover a new generated world each time you play. Explore hundreds of wild and interesting mods on the Steam Workshop. Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor. RimWorld is a story generator. It’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller . There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax. Your colonists are not professional settlers – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew. Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well. Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound. The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season. Travel across the planet. You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster. You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms. People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down. Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous. You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs. And there's much more than that! The game is easy to mod and has an active modding community on the Steam Workshop.",

        "description": "RoboBall is a game in which you control a ball-shaped robot and solve physics- and logic-based puzzles. Your goal is to control various mechanisms in order to reach the end of the level, where you will find a teleporter that will take you to the next level. Puzzles On every stage you will find a large number of different mechanisms, buttons, laser switches, and doors. To open a door, start an elevator, or simply activate a certain mechanism, you will need to activate a button. Sometimes you can't do it by yourself and will need some help from metal balls, barrels, or crates. But don't forget that they might also need your help to perform certain actions. Workshop RoboBall has a level editor that is very flexible and packed with functionality. All of the levels in the game were created using this editor. Place static objects such as zones, paths, glass tubes, and metal tracks. Active objects perform various functions. These include doors, elevators, and machines that create metal balls, crates, or barrels. Buttons deserve special attention. You can use them to open or close doors, activate elevators, or deactivate turbines that are preventing you or any other physical object from advancing. There are two different kinds of buttons in the game: switches, which activate the objects they are linked to and then turn them off again when pressed a second time, and triggers, which activate objects as long as you or another physical object remains on top of them. When the object leaves the trigger, the objects linked to the button are deactivated. Once you've created a level you can publish it in the workshop. You can also play other players' levels.",

A land of elves, with the blessings of the World Tree. A land of mechanical ingenuity, where super-science rules the world. A land of wilderness and dust, ruled by demons.

        "description": "This War of Mine: Final Cut contains all the updates and free expansions released so far and introduces not only a new scenario but also expands all scenarios with the locations known from Stories DLCs - even if you don’t own those. In short words - that means you can now experience lots of never-seen-before playthroughs and struggle with new challenges. Main changes: Remastered versions of all the classic locations One new classic scenario and a brand-new character New quests and locations added to the original game Vanilla version of the game ABOUT THIS WAR OF MINE: In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better. This War of Mine - main features: Inspired by real-life events Control your survivors and manage your shelter Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves – anything that helps you survive Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme The universe of This War of Mine has been expanded by following DLCs: The Little Ones - explores the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective - that of a child. This War of Mine: Stories DLCs: Episode 1: The Father's Promise – a heartbreaking tale of loss and hope in a war-torn city Episode 2: The Last Broadcast – where, as a radio operator, you are going to face moral dilemmas and decide, whether there is a price too high for the truth Episode 3: Fading Embers – portrays a story of Anja living in a warzone and carrying a heavy burden as she has to answer to herself what is more important - survival of human legacy or the survival of a man",

        "description": "Wildgate is a PvPvE multiplayer shooter with 3 different modes. In Artifact Brawl, be the first to snatch the Artifact and blast through the Wildgate, or destroy the ships of every rival crew to be crowned the winner. Fleet Battle pits two massive teams of up to 12 players each against one another in relentless, action-packed combat. For a more relaxed looting expedition, salvage treasure and escape with the spoils before getting blown up in Treasure Hunt. Across all modes your ship is your home and lifeline for you and your prospector crew. Keep it topped up with ice, fuel and ammo so you're ready for anyone or anything the Reach throws at you. Blast your enemies with hi-tech cannons and gadgets, lure them into deadly traps, or even mess with their ship... as long as they don't sabotage yours first. When your perfect plan goes out the airlock, there's only one option... wing it! Stay one step ahead as you and your crew navigate the Reach — a vast, ever-changing procedurally-generated map that changes with every game. Choose from a variety of daring prospectors, each with their own abilities and tools. Whether you want to be a brave pilot holding down the ship or a clever trickster boarding enemy ships, there's no wrong way to commit space crimes! The Reach is a dangerous, unpredictable place, filled with deadly hazards and treasure beyond your wildest dreams. Navigate through cosmic storms, battle space creatures, and plunder ancient alien ruins for lost caches of loot. Just make sure you beat the other prospectors to the punch, or you'll fly away empty-handed!",
