At first it may be difficult to get used to all the intricate mechanics and understand how to apply them or why they are needed in the fight against your opponent, but through practice and training, as well as sufficient theoretical background, you can become a master of hens. The foundation of the game Broilers, in a way, could be called Tower-Defense, except that in addition to defense, both players are also responsible for attacking and advancing toward the opponent's base. Of course, following this characteristic, many games could be called Tower-Defence, but usually in such games the elements of attacking the enemy, and in the case of Broilers they are pawns, are completely under the control of the player, or under control for the most part. In Broilers, however, players cannot directly control the pawns-the players cannot tell the pawns where to go or what to do. You can say that in this game, you are under the control of creeps (units not controlled by the player), which is already very similar to the Tower-Defence genre, as well as there are almost literal TD elements, such as eggs, which can be placed on the field, which, although not shooting at the enemy, but can become an obstacle to him. May the strongest win It is important to understand that in Broilers, victory is primarily achieved by the ability to skillfully prioritize the characteristics of species, the assignment of cards to pawns, and the timely creation of species and assigning them a program for action.",

So I ended up building Ringtoner, a small app to make it easier. With it you can: Upload audio or videos to create ringtones you like Extract audio from videos and set it as your ringtone Turn any sound into ringtones, text tones, or alerts Use 200+ ready-made tones, or try popular sounds from social media It’s only been out for a little while, and I’d really like to get some feedback. For now, the lifetime membership (normally $9.9) is free until September 30. Please feel free to try. If you find the app useful, I’d really appreciate it if you could leave a review.

        "description": "Indebted to the wrong people, with his life on the line, veteran of the U.S. Cavalry and now hired gun, Booker DeWitt has only one opportunity to wipe his slate clean. He must rescue Elizabeth, a mysterious girl imprisoned since childhood and locked up in the flying city of Columbia. Forced to trust one another, Booker and Elizabeth form a powerful bond during their daring escape. Together, they learn to harness an expanding arsenal of weapons and abilities, as they fight on zeppelins in the clouds, along high-speed Sky-Lines, and down in the streets of Columbia, all while surviving the threats of the air-city and uncovering its dark secret. Key Features The City in the Sky – Leave the depths of Rapture to soar among the clouds of Columbia. A technological marvel, the flying city is a beautiful and vibrant world that holds a very dark secret. Unlikely Mission – Set in 1912, hired gun Booker DeWitt must rescue a mysterious girl from the sky-city of Columbia or never leave it alive. Whip, Zip, and Kill – Turn the city’s Sky-Lines into weaponized roller coasters as you zip through the flying city and dish out fatal hands-on punishment. Tear Through Time – Open Tears in time and space to shape the battlefield and turn the tide in combat by pulling weapons, turrets, and other resources out of thin air. Vigorous Powers – Throw explosive fireballs, shoot lightning, and release murders of crows as devastatingly powerful Vigors surge through your body to be unleashed against all that oppose you. Custom Combat Experience – With deadly weapons in one hand, powerful Vigors in the other, and the ability to open Tears in time and space, fight your own way through the floating city of Columbia to rescue Elizabeth and reach freedom. 1999 Mode – Upon finishing BioShock Infinite, the player can unlock a game mode called “1999 Mode” that gives experienced players a taste of the kind of design and balance that hardcore gamers enjoyed back in the 20th century.",

        "description": "UPDATE 2: Unfortunately it looks like the mystery items aren't games but coupons. So the final count is 2 games (Ninja Issen and Eternal Rebirth : Curses of Love at 25 days each), one 2,000 won Coupon at 10 days, and a 15% coupon at 20 days. Also a Riichi City only 3,000 won coupon at 15 days. Thanks to oFallenAngel, kph002, and Scorpion101325 for the info. UPDATE: There has been a change to the giveaway, but unfortunately I can't edit the post title as far as I know so I'll have to just explain it here. Many thanks to kwama57, asadx47, and PanTsour for the info. It seems that several of the games have been changed to hidden \"Coming Soon\" items that may or may not be the same as before. There are two that still seem confirmed Ninja Issen and Eternal Rebirth : Curses of Love both for 25 days. However the other games have been changed to 3 mystery items for 10, 15, and 20 days total with the other one replaced with flakes. To summarize, total number of items seemingly reduced to 5. The three at 10, 15, and 20 days replaced with mystery items. Ninja Issen and Eternal Rebirth : Curses of Love still listed at 25 days each. Stove is giving away another 6 games during September. The only catch is that you have to download their launcher and play a couple of games each day. The games are for the Stove store and use the Stove launcher. Four Games here: https://event.onstove.com/en/dailyshop/STOVEINDIE/202509 Gravity Circuit (5 days), Elypse (10 Days), Fabledom (20 Days) , 2,000 won Coupon (10 days), 15% coupon (20 days), and Ninja Issen (25 days). To get them you just need to run a game from their launcher each day and then check in on that webpage. I believe that Riichi City, LORD NINE, Epic SEVEN, and BTS Cooking on Stove are excluded. Plus logging in gets $1.60 in free store credit coupons. And the free games will likely have missions you can do for more store credit and discount coupons. Note: Elypse is a duplicate from last month. If you already have a game then they give you flakes instead when you try to redeem it and no bonus missions. Flakes can be used to sometimes exchange for more free games on this same page. You can see this official post for more information: https://page.onstove.com/indie/global/view/11031124 Two games here: https://event.onstove.com/en/dailyshop/RIICHICITY_IND/202509 Caravan Sandwich (15 Days) and Eternal Rebirth : Curses of Love (25 Days). WARNING: Eternal Rebirth : Curses of Love is given a 19+ rating. Though seemingly only a Teen rating on the Epic store . Not sure what's up with that. Same deal as above, except you need to play Riichi City, using their launcher and a stove connected account, to qualify for the check in. Steam links for review reading. https://store.steampowered.com/app/858710/Gravity_Circuit/ https://store.steampowered.com/app/1725340/Elypse/ https://store.steampowered.com/app/1651560/Fabledom/ https://store.steampowered.com/app/1714550/Ninja_Issen https://store.steampowered.com/app/1582650/Caravan_SandWitch/ No luck with Eternal Rebirth : Curses of Love. Other notes. There's $5 + 50% off, and a few other extras, for accounts under 7 days old here: https://event.onstove.com/en/welcome And a deal for accounts 7-30 days old that haven't agreed to game terms and haven't made a puchase (pick one of 8 games): https://event.onstove.com/en/welcome-for-you There's also a random free DLC available but it requires both the base game and one of the other DLC for that game: https://store.onstove.com/en/games/102385 Some other basically always free stuff. GigaBash Under the blue horizon - Aquarium Knight Overloaded Infinite Incarnation Also there's a DLC for Kalpa: Cosmic Symphony that requires the base game.

Obvs! Scene: Enter the Square, the bizarre home planet of the Polytopians, a flat, square-shaped landmass drifting in the space of an alternate dimension to ours. A relatively simple and curious folk that has a penchant for fighting, the Polytopians are 16 individual tribes spread out across the Square, each with their own characteristics, motivations, strengths, and weaknesses. As a player, you will take on the role of the ruler of one of these tribes as you attempt to build your civilization in competition with the other tribes. Will you choose to be the leader of the Xin-Xi, reserved yet adventurous traditionalists who are wary of change or outsiders? Perhaps the Hoodrick, who love archery, nature, and mushrooms, and are famed for their baked goods! Or maybe the Bardur, where the local tavern is their favorite place and Ullefurgh their drink choice, a delightful concoction of pine needles, hot water, and rabbit fat. Deeeelicious!! But beware of the Vengir, purple rhino-pig riding warriors who, in between bouts of pillaging, like to sharpen their swords and vacation at the misty Kithkga Boneyards. You really don’t want to get on their bad side!",

        "description": "Secret agent Franklin Benjamin's former-mentor-turned-rogue-agent Dustin MacGuffin - once known as Agent 606 - has resurfaced to take from you that which you hold most dear. In this single-player interactive spy novel, play as secret agent Franklin Benjamin - aka Agent 707 - and use your particular set of skills to save Virginia from the clutches of the madman Dustin MacGuffin. Which means - you’d better get the MacGuffin! It's 707 vs. 606 - who will come out on top? And whose number is up? Your Mission It was supposed to be the rarest of all things - a day with no mission. That is, until you woke up to find Virginia gone and a note left behind telling you she had been taken. That note was left behind by your old partner, Dustin MacGuffin, who's since gone rogue - now he's up to something and using her as leverage to keep you from getting involved. Talk about a grave miscalculation Now, you're taking matters into your own hands to get her back. This is not a sanctioned mission, so you're on your own this time using resources outside the usual channels. But you will get the MacGuffin ... whatever it takes There's Always a Madman: The MacGuffin can be played with just a mouse. Gameplay consists of selecting the action or dialog you wish to take given the situation you’re facing. Although the life of a secret agent is complicated, playing There's Always a Madman: The MacGuffin is simple Sequel or Standalone There's Always a Madman: The MacGuffin is the fourth entry in the There's Always a Madman series, but it tells a standalone story. Like a classic James Bond novel or film where you can pick any one up independent of the rest, you can pick this story up without having experienced any prior stories in the There's Always a Madman franchise. However, I would recommend starting with the first game There's Always a Madman: Fight or Flight if you care to experience the series in its intended order Make Them Talk Will you go on a full rampage or are you just a professional applying your particular set of skills? Choose the tools for how you want to get the job done, interrogate the henchmen standing in your path, and work your way up the chain to get to the man behind it all This Time, It's Personal For the first time in the There's Always a Madman series, we learn what Franklin Benjamin was like as a rookie agent and how he paired with his mentor at the time - the agency's top man, Dustin MacGuffin Sounds like a Winner Although the game is text-based like a novel, an emphasis is placed on visuals and music to set the appropriate mood for each scene, changing based on whether you're in a safe location or you're exposed to danger. It also features a theme song (with lyrics) written specifically for this game Short and Not-So-Sweet There's Always A Madman: The MacGuffin aims to be about the length of a movie for a single playthrough (roughly two hours). During that time, you may very well have to do some not-so-nice things to succeed. But that's okay - as they say, nice guys finish last. And you to come out on top For reference, here are some similar games outside the There's Always a Madman series to help you get a further sense for what the There's Always A Madman games are like: GoldenEye 007 (and other James Bond games like Everything or Nothing), Mission: Impossible, Alpha Protocol, Splinter Cell: Conviction, Henchman Story, Agent A: A Puzzle in Disguise, Framed, I Expect You To Die, Batman Telltale Series, The Wolf Among Us Q: Why make this game text-based? Why not use visuals? A: James Bond, Jason Bourne, Jack Reacher, and Jack Ryan all started off in text format with novels. I believe this is the right move for the project - as they say, the book is always better, so I think a more book-like experience works here. The game's text will of course be supplemented with music to set the appropriate mood, such as whether you're in danger or in a safe spot Get the MacGuffin before the MacGuffin gets you! Each game in the There's Always a Madman series is designed as a standalone adventure, but if you wish to play the games in order, this is the order of release (and the recommended order to play): 1. There's Always a Madman: Fight or Flight 2. There's Always a Madman: Do Your Worst 3. There's Always a Madman: Bring the Thunder 4. There's Always a Madman: The MacGuffin 5. There's Always a Madman: V.I.C.T.O.R. And don't forget to check out my debut game, the cozy RPG A Weekend in Puzzleburg . There's Always a Madman is technically a spin-off of A Weekend in Puzzleburg since There's Always a Madman is based on the Franklin Benjamin character first seen on a channel from the Puzzleburg hotel room TV",
