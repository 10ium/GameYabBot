You will play as a retard \"Liu Jie,\" who has occupational habits. In the fast-paced life of a metropolis, through your main job as a new media worker and your side gig as a barista at a café, you'll spend one abstract yet ordinary day after another with your partners. Every ordinary day we live might be a miracle unfolding in succession. Who knows... Maybe Liu Jie is the greatest miracle of all. Project Introduction Ai Love serves as the prologue work of the series project Before The Rainbow , developed by 律合 Works in their spare time out of passion as an AVG (Interactive Fiction) game. The project aims to facilitate technical exchange and entertainment through playful references, functioning as both a practical example and a (not-so) serious AVG game for players to enjoy. Everyone involved is contributing wholeheartedly to this project out of love. Function and Gameplay Introduction This game is built on NVL Maker (Kirikiri2 KagEX2 Kag eXpress3), with optimized and additional features that enhance the AVG gaming experience based on NVL Maker's core functions. It combines AVG and ADV gameplay, interspersing small gameplay elements like cultivation, daily activities, and strategy within the story that can be progressed by pressing Enter. Players can experience the charm of abstract realism through the main story, which spans approximately 50,000 to 70,000 words.

Prepare yourselves to build, lead, fight, and change the course of history! ROAD REDEMPTION Road Redemption is an action racing game where you lead your motorcycle gang on an epic journey across the country in a brutal driving combat adventure, taking heavy inspiration from series such as Road Rash and Motorstorm. Earn money by completing races, assassinations, robberies, and other challenges in your path. As you collect loot, you'll upgrade your character, your bike, and your weapons. One Life To Live Driving a motorcycle at 100 mph while trying to hit someone with a pipe is dangerous, and death can come quickly. Fortunately, every time you die, all the experience you've collected can be used to upgrade your character, your bike, and your weapons. In the multiplayer splitscreen, 4 friends can work together to let out some road rage in the coop campaign. A Truly Epic Quest Road Redemption takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, ruled by a brutal dictator. Fans of Mad Max will feel right at home here. After years of bloody street warfare, the country's biker gangs have settled into an uneasy truce. This period of peace is interrupted when the leader of the country's richest weapons cartel is assassinated, and a $15,000,000 bounty is put on the mysterious assassin's head. It's up to you and your fellow gang members to chase down the assassin and claim this prize, but you'll have to drive through enemy territory to do so. Every biker in the country wants a piece of that $15,000,000 bounty, and they won't hesitate to take out those who get in their way. Other Features Tons of brutal weapons. This is more Twisted Metal or Burnout than it is Mario Kart 4-player splitscreen co-op. 2-4 player multimonitor co-op. Every player gets his own screen! Massive, expandable skill tree. Rack in the loot to upgrade your character, your bike, and your weapons. A deep motorcycle fighting system with grabs, kicks, counters, critical strikes, and more. Full support for both mouse & keyboard and gamepad control configurations.",

        "description": "END OF THE ROAD Since the premiere, Frostpunk has been enriched with a number of updates. You can enjoy the new Endless Mode (with 3 ways of playing it) that increases the replayability of the game. There is also a new scenario - The Fall of Winterhome , that further expands the game’s universe and lore. And for the dessert, we’ve added things like naming characters and automatons and finally a photo mode . All of this is available for free for all the owners of the game. There are also three expansions, available with the paid Season Pass . At the same time we would like to inform you that we are not planning to create any more content for Frostpunk, as this journey is over for us, but there are more to come in the future, so be sure to keep an eye out for our games. Of course the game will still receive patches and fixes and we’ll provide the technical support. SEASON PASS The Official Season Pass for Frostpunk is out and complete! It grants you access to all additional content released for the game since the premiere, including three expansions ( The Last Autumn , On The Edge and The Rifts ), that widely broaden the main story and fill a lot of gaps in the game’s universe. What’s more, when you’re done with the game itself, you’ll be able to unwind while listening to the Digital Soundtrack featuring orchestrated music or learn more about the world with the exclusive Digital Artbook . Not having the game at all? Worry no more, as the Frostpunk: Game of the Year Edition is what you are looking for. It includes the main game, season pass and all exclusive content at a discounted price. ABOUT THE GAME THE CITY MUST SURVIVE Frostpunk, the newest title from the creators of This War of Mine, is a society survival game where heat means life and every decision comes at a price. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive. Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state. What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process? MAKE THE LAW Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there’s no turning back. WEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden. DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills. EXPLORE THE FROSTLAND While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands. PLAY ENDLESSLY Frostpunk Endless Mode grants you unlimited replayability for the game. Play on 8 various maps, with different terrain, weather conditions and challenges to face. We know that different people look for different experiences and that’s why there are 3 modes to play in Endless Mode. Endurance will be an ultimate test to your building, managing and survival skills in the harshest conditions. Builders, where there is no generator available from the start, which creates a different type of challenge. And last but not least, Serenity which is focused on enjoying the art of building the city itself, without unnecessary pressure.",

        "description": "Overview DRAGON QUEST MONSTERS: The Dark Prince comes to Steam®! Compose your very own team of monsters from across the DRAGON QUEST series and engage in thrilling battles against your foes. Recruit monsters from the wild world around you and combine them to synthesize new creatures as you see fit. With over 500 monsters to choose from and a revamped synthesis system to explore, you can mix and match to you heart's content to create your favorite cute critters and dastardly supervillains, as well as brand-new additions to the monstrous roll call. Your quest to become the greatest monster wrangler of all time starts here! Story Psaro is cursed and is unable to harm anything with monster blood. Now, he must become a Monster Wrangler to create an army for battle. The hunt for high-ranked monsters takes Psaro through the ever-changing seasons of Nadiria and its unique environments, with rivers of bubbling lava, mysterious ancient ruins, and soaring towers of cake. Along the way, Psaro meets the kind-hearted elf, Rose, who joins his adventure to seek out ever-stronger monsters. The key to Psaro's success lies with synthesis: the ability to combine two monsters and create a stronger offspring. Each new creation brings Psaro one step closer to his goal of becoming the Master of Monsterkind. (The network mode Online Battles from the console version, where players battle one another in real time, is not included.) Game Features - A Wondrous World Awaits As time passes in Nadiria, so too do the seasons change, with different weather conditions tempting new monsters out of hiding and revealing paths to undiscovered areas. The Circles of Nadiria are sure to provide a fresh experience every time you visit. - Over 500 Unique Monsters With such varied environments to explore, you can expect them to be inhabited by a plethora of monsters. While many can be recruited in battle, occasionally a defeated monster will ask to join your team of its own accord. Befriend as many monsters as you can, then combine them to synthesize new creatures and build a unique party to your exact liking. - Enjoy All the DLC from the Console Version The Steam® version includes the DLC packs from the console version: the Mole Hole, Coach Joe's Dungeon Gym and Treasure Trunks. Make the most of their unique features to enhance your adventure. - Test Your Might in Quickfire Contests Register your team for the network mode Quickfire Contests to participate in automated battles against the party data of 30 other players. Once a day you can earn stat-boosting items as a prize, and the monsters from any team you defeat will be added to your roster (up to rank B monsters only).",

        "description": "MAINFRAME DEFENDERS Tactical retrofuturistic strategy game. A computer virus has infiltrated the \"Stargazer\" research complex. Most of the robotic units are controlled by the virus. Lead a squad of 4 prototypes on a mission to defend complex mainframe. You'll have to repel assaults, destroy unit fabricators, download valuable data, clear infected nodes, and do more on your way to the deepest parts of the complex. Work with item limitations and drawbacks to build powerful combinations. Destroy your enemies with diverse tactics: overheat them, melt with corrosion, absorb damage, and return fire. But don't rely on a single strategy too much - enemies might have a way to counter it. But above everything else: defend the Mainframe! * RETRO STYLE: Graphics, inspired by 80s terminal PC with hybrid synthwave soundtrack. * DIVERSE TACTICS: Cook enemy robots to death, bury them under your bullets, eliminate with a single powerful shot, or render your opponents useless with debuffs - this game is designed with a lot of viable strategies in mind. * BUILD YOUR SQUAD: Similar to how in card games you have to build your deck, in Mainframe Defenders you have to combine different items with unique abilities, to create an unstoppable squad. Work with item drawbacks or double down on them, creating flawed, yet powerful build! * UNIQUE ENEMIES: Enemy squad won't sit idle, though. Each unit has its own role in the squad and designed to counter certain strategies. Pick your targets wisely, or you will lose. * PROCEDURAL LEVELS: Hand-made rooms are combined with procedural generation to create random levels. Missions have differing objectives, combined with unique mission conditions. Will you accept the challenge or avoid the unknown and risk falling behind? * PROGRESSION SYSTEM: Victory or defeat, the game is not over yet! Unlock new units, each with a unique set of upgrades and load-outs. Unlock new items to bolster your new strategies. Synthetic Domain is a small team of hobbyists with a passion for making games. We are working with limited resources to deliver quality games focusing on polish and execution. We look at indie games, games from the 90s and 00s for our inspiration, hoping to bring some of the spirit of this era to the modern age.",

The game introduces a weird but sweet character named A-Eye. He is an artificial intelligence created to process data for important scientific research. When he gets bored with this assignment, he decides to turn the research into a video game. The fact that he can't draw game assets or compose music and knows nothing about game design is not going to stop him. A-Eye will be extremely glad if you become an impartial critic for him. Make your own opinion on the game he's been working on and find out his story full of life, death, rain, and dandelions. What you should know before you play: It will take you about an hour to complete the game. The gameplay consists of dialogues with the main character and of playing the game he is creating. You will need to stop falling blocks. If a block goes beyond the bottom edge of the screen, you will lose a life. The previous sentence might not sound very exciting, but you should consider that the blocks are going to look different and have unique properties.

        "description": "The ultimate test of trust and betrayal: do your friends have your back or will they leave you bleeding in the snow? Project Winter is an 8-person multiplayer game of survival and social deception, where cooperation is essential, but betrayal is inevitable. Stranded in the frozen wilderness, survivors must gather resources, repair objectives, and fight the elements to escape. But hidden among them are traitors working together to sabotage, mislead, and eliminate their so-called allies. Project Winter 2.0: Cabin Fever introduces a faster, more streamlined experience that keeps the paranoia and chaos alive while making it easier than ever for new players to jump in. For seasoned players, the punishing Classic mode remains - demanding coordination, grit, and sharp instincts to survive. No two matches are ever the same. Whether you’re chopping firewood with allies, whispering over secret radios as a traitor, or panicking when a sudden blizzard forces everyone together, the tension builds with every decision. PROJECT WINTER ROLES Survivor As a survivor you will have to complete a series of objectives in order to call in one of several rescue vehicles and escape to win the game. Repair all the objectives to restore the cabin radio to working order. Break rocks, harvest berries and herbs, and cut down trees to earn crafting materials used to repair objectives, and help keep you alive. Explore crates found in the buildings scattered throughout the map which contain items that will help you survive and complete your objectives. Traitor As a traitor your goal is to stop the survivors from escaping without being identified or killed. All of your teammates will be revealed to you at the start of the match and can be identified by a red traitor symbol, much like yours. You will start with a red radio to communicate with your fellow traitor. Use traitor crates and hatches scattered throughout the map to gain advantage against survivors. FEATURES Teamwork & Survival : Survivors can’t make it alone. Work together to endure the cold, complete objectives, and fend off wildlife. Betrayal & Deception : Traitors blend in, gain trust, and then strike when the moment is right. Anyone could be the enemy! Communication : Proximity voice, radio channels, text chat, and emotes keep every interaction charged with suspicion. Multiple Modes : Choose between streamlined Cabin Fever, unforgiving Classic, or customize your own rules for the perfect dose of paranoia. Cosmetics & Progression : Unlock stylish looks and personalize your character with cosmetics available in our in-game store, progression trees, or in-game drops. Can you trust your friends long enough to survive? Or will you be the reason no one makes it out alive?",
