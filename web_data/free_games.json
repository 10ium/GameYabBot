Tyre dynamics are first-in-class, utilising an advanced “brush” model that accurately portrays slip angles and models advanced features such as vehicle “flat spots” that you can really feel. For wheel users, the 400Hz physics engine is directly translated into force feedback, delivering a highly detailed and predictable feeling to your steering wheel with presets available directly collaborated on with a number of prominent equipment manufacturers. The game also features improved in-game controller support as well as a selectable and customisable difficulty level – to allow the player to determine their own skill level with help for first timers allowing adjustable assists. DYNAMIC RACING EXPERIENCE Realistic day and night cycles are a key element of this simulation with incredible lighting effects as you race into dusk, through night and again into dawn down the Mulsanne at over 200mph. Le Mans Ultimate uses an advancement in Real Road 2.0 track evolution simulation found uniquely in Studio 397 titles. Like a real race session, the track will begin as a green, relatively gripless circuit at the start of a weekend and rubber in as more cars pass over the racing line – with cars moving the dust, dirt and marbles off-line. Work has been undertaken in several areas, including the dynamic weather effects too, such as rainfall and debris on windscreens and more realistic flow of water and formation of puddles on the circuit. The cars will also change throughout the race, and the build-up of dirt and debris will cover the car – giving it the authentic weathered, endurance look. MULTIPLAYER - COMPETE IN SKILL BASED EVENTS OR MANAGE YOUR OWN SERVER For those looking for the edge of the seat, wheel-to-wheel competition against real-life drivers, the Online function, powered by RaceControl, will be home to that pulsating challenge.

If you can find them in the game, you can possess them! ● As the game progresses, discover more masks that embody the spirit of ancient heroes.

With different personalities and talents, you can recruit bloodthirsty warriors, dexterous hunters, and ingenious craftsmen. . . and even a drunk lazy alcoholic! ● Powerful AI and command support allows you to set up and manage the work flow of clan members with a high degree of freedom: farming, harvesting, assembly line production, base patrol, automatic repair and even maintenance...everything can be automated and customized by you. Even if you're AFK (away from keyboard), your tribesmen will keep working, enabling the tribe to continue growing and thriving. ● Need a light? Smoke a cig or pop open a beer after a busy day. Take a hot bath and soothe those aching muscles. Your tribesmen will always find something of their own to do after work (or even at work -_-).

Observe the weak points of your opponents' bases while pushing the limits of your own fortress design!

        "description": "From the acclaimed team behind Blasphemous , NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound successfully unites the classic lore and gameplay of the Tecmo-developed (now KOEI TECMO GAMES) NINJA GAIDEN series from the 8-bit era with the depth and intensity of the modern 3D entries. The best of both eras come together to create an epic and thrilling adventure. Our story begins when Ryu Hayabusa journeys to America to honor his father's will. While he is away, the barrier between the human and the demon worlds suddenly shatters, unleashing a terrifying army upon the Hayabusa Village, which now faces an unprecedented threat in Ryu's absence. To stand against this new threat, Kenji Mozu , a young ninja from the Hayabusa Village, rises to the challenge! Trained by Ryu, he fights fiercely but soon finds himself in desperate straits. Forced to tap into forbidden power, Kenji sets aside centuries of animosity and forms an alliance with the sinister Black Spider Clan , convinced that combining their souls and skills is the only way to protect the world out of the Demon Lord's grasp! Combining old-school feeling with modern precision, NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound retains the pick-up-and-play action of the classic titles, while introducing new layers of depth. Alongside the new protagonist, Kenji Mozu, is the skilled assassin Kumori . Take control of these two powerful ninjas simultaneously and unravel their interconnected stories. Use the Ninja Fusion to unleash devastating abilities and obliterate your enemies. NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound features impeccable mechanics that are easy to learn but hard to truly master, challenging the skills of even the most seasoned fans of the NINJA GAIDEN series! Step into a reimagined version of the classic NINJA GAIDEN universe, brought to life through stunning, meticulously crafted visuals. Every enemy is recreated with a level of detail that was once impossible. The brutal, nostalgia-filled aesthetic of NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound pays homage to the past while pushing the boundaries of modern pixel art, making every battle a feast for the eyes. Do you have what it takes to become a true ninja master?",

However, it was a Pyrrhic victory: Whole regions have fallen into anarchy, refugees roam the lands in search of shelter, and a mysterious, deadly plague called the “Bloodburn” has arisen and is spreading rapidly. In times like these people cling to any sign of hope they can find. The Purity of Light, led by a charismatic man called Rondar Lacaine, claims that mages are the source of all misfortune – and that only the second coming of Aonir, the father of all gods, will return Eo to its former splendor.

        "description": "Hey r/AppHookup , indie dev here. I built ReDo Loop because my calendar kept filling up with things that were not real events. Changing filters, replacing toothbrushes, haircuts, routine checkups, and similar recurring tasks. Calendars work great for one time, unmissable events, but for recurring life maintenance they always felt like the wrong tool. So ReDo Loop focuses only on recurring tasks you want to offload from your calendar . The feature that ended up mattering most for me is Relaxed repeats . The interval starts after you complete the task . For example, replace a toothbrush every 3 months after it is done, not on a fixed date. It also supports: fixed schedules such as specific dates or weekdays positional rules like first Monday or last weekend daily routines, one time tasks, and simple tracking where you log when something was done Privacy wise, everything is stored locally. No accounts, no ads, no analytics. I am running a New Year lifetime offer on both iOS and Android and would really appreciate feedback from this community: does the recurring model make sense? anything missing or confusing? features you would expect next? Happy to answer questions or take criticism.

        "description": "Defeat an AI in this co-op party game! Deviation Game is a co-op party game for 2-6 players that pits human creativity against AI perception. Your goal: draw secret prompts like \"Flamingo\" in a way humans can understand, but an image recognition AI can't! Up to 6 people can play with one copy If just one person owns the Steam game, everyone can join by watching that player’s screen. Up to 6 players can join for free using their smartphones’ web browsers via a QR code. How to play 1. Join using your own device Using your mobile device, scan the QR or enter the room code at outdraw.ai to transform your device into the game’s controller! 2. The drawer picks a prompt The drawer first picks a secret prompt from categories such as objects, actions or even concepts. 3. Time to deviate! Then they just gotta draw it! But remember, the aim is to trick the AI while making sure your friends still get the picture! 4. Everyone (plus the AI) guesses Once the drawer is done, all the guessers will submit their best guess, including the AI! Choose carefully, you only get one chance! 5. The answer is revealed! If you fail to fool and the AI guesses right, then humans lose! If the AI fails and humans guess right, then humans win! AI to enhance (not replace) creativity By embracing the medium of games, Deviation Game aims to use AI as a collaborative tool that seeks not to replace human creativity but to enhance it. Through the game, players learn to express themselves in new ways to deviate from what the AI has already learned, making for a fun and brain-teasing party experience, where you’ll create things no one has ever seen before! Flipping Alan Turing’s revolutionary 1950 Imitation Game on its head, Deviation Game encourages players to fool the AI instead of the AI trying to fool them. Keeping consent clear At the end of each game, players can consent to their drawing being used to potentially train the AI... or not! Allowing you to decide how the game may evolve. Collection is opt-out by default, and all data without consent will be deleted. By working together, players from around the world can collectively uncover the biases in large AI models by exposing their blind spots in interpreting diverse, culturally specific drawings. Played by humans around the world Deviation Game was initially showcased as an art installation at Civic Creative Base Tokyo in 2023. The work has since been shown in globally renowned exhibitions, such as Ars Electronica, Taipei Digital Art Festival, and Now Play This, engaging audiences of all ages and sparking critical discussions around AI and creativity. About the creators Deviation Game was developed and self-published by a group of good friends consisting mainly of game designer Tomo Kihara and art-design duo Playfool (Daniel Coppen & Saki Maruyama). With a focus on play, their practice centres around designing tools that foster creativity and making artistic interventions that engage with urban space and society. Their previous work How (not) to get hit by a self-driving car received an Honorary Mention in the S+T+ARTS Prize 2024 at Ars Electronica. Deviation Game is their first experience to self-publish an indie game. FAQ Q. How exactly does the AI guess? A: In each round, the AI will return numerous guesses, depending on the number of players in the game. If one of those answers are correct, AI wins! Q: Doesn’t the AI just have access to all the prompt words? Surely it’s cheating! A: Not at all! While some examples are provided to the AI to give it more context, it is freely guessing each answer it submits, which is why sometimes they’re a little off-base. Q: What AI model are you using? A: Throughout Early Access, we are experimenting with various AI models via the service OpenRouter. In the future, we plan to introduce a feature that allows players to choose which AI model to go up against. Q: Does the game’s AI get smarter after each game? A: No, the AI is not learning in real-time. However, custom improvements to the AI can be made with a future update after enough data has been collected to retrain the model. Q: How is our drawing data being collected? A: We only collect drawing data that has been given explicit consent. Collection is opt-out by default, and all data without consent will be deleted.

        "description": "The 9th Charnel is a first-person psychological survival horror game. Filled with a rich and frightening atmosphere, this game aims at providing a haunting and desperate action-survival experience. While exploring the many mysteries of this world, you must survive- whether you do it through stealth or by using weapons. Most of the time, the player has to survive impossible threats through stealth and clever navigation of the environment. As the player progresses through the game and threats grow significantly more complex, the player uncovers new stories and receives new weapons. At its scariest, the game preys on the player’s anxiety, survival, and Exploration skills. It takes place in a not-so-future world, where people have lost faith in the prosperity of human development, people are selfish, and governments are corrupt. The 9th Charnel takes the player on a journey through a world filled with terror and suspense. With realistic graphics, an immersive soundtrack, and a captivating storyline, this game offers an unforgettable experience for fans of the horror genre. In this game, the player takes on the role of Michael J. Jones (one of 6 characters). All the character are well fleshed out, each with their own unique backstory and motivations. The inventory system allows the player to gather resources and manage their supplies, while the weapon combat and stealth mechanics keep the player on their toes. As the player progresses through the game, they will encounter various puzzles and challenges that test their survival skills and their ability to think on their feet. With a heavy focus on story, The 9th Charnel offers a rich, narrative experience that will keep players engaged and on the edge of their seat. Michael and his colleagues - Sara Whitlock and Daniel J. Hart- are genetic scientists at The Epsilon Research Institute. In one of their curriculum, they decide to conduct research at the nearest wildlife sanctuary. On their ill-fated journey, they encounter an inconceivable incident. As a result, their car rolls down the road into a deep valley-type area. Stuck in a valley, alone, Michael must find his friends and survive multiple dangerous life-threatening incidents that lead them to believe that the place has a history of evil activities. To see the fate of the three friends, play to the end. Overall, The 9th Charnel is a horror game that combines intense atmosphere, strategic thinking, and a gripping story-line to create a truly unique gaming experience.",

        "description": "RimWorld is a sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller. Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune. You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world. Manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, illnesses and addictions. Build in the forest, desert, jungle, tundra, and more. Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses. Replace wounded limbs and organs with prosthetics, bionics, or biological parts harvested from others. Fight pirates, tribes, mad animals, giant insects and ancient killing machines. Craft structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, and futuristic materials. Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts. Trade with passing ships and caravans. Form caravans to complete quests, trade, attack other factions, or migrate your whole colony. Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires. Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery. Discover a new generated world each time you play. Explore hundreds of wild and interesting mods on the Steam Workshop. Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor. RimWorld is a story generator. It’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller . There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax. Your colonists are not professional settlers – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew. Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well. Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound. The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season. Travel across the planet. You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster. You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms. People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down. Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous. You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs. And there's much more than that! The game is easy to mod and has an active modding community on the Steam Workshop.",

        "description": "RoboBall is a game in which you control a ball-shaped robot and solve physics- and logic-based puzzles. Your goal is to control various mechanisms in order to reach the end of the level, where you will find a teleporter that will take you to the next level. Puzzles On every stage you will find a large number of different mechanisms, buttons, laser switches, and doors. To open a door, start an elevator, or simply activate a certain mechanism, you will need to activate a button. Sometimes you can't do it by yourself and will need some help from metal balls, barrels, or crates. But don't forget that they might also need your help to perform certain actions. Workshop RoboBall has a level editor that is very flexible and packed with functionality. All of the levels in the game were created using this editor. Place static objects such as zones, paths, glass tubes, and metal tracks. Active objects perform various functions. These include doors, elevators, and machines that create metal balls, crates, or barrels. Buttons deserve special attention. You can use them to open or close doors, activate elevators, or deactivate turbines that are preventing you or any other physical object from advancing. There are two different kinds of buttons in the game: switches, which activate the objects they are linked to and then turn them off again when pressed a second time, and triggers, which activate objects as long as you or another physical object remains on top of them. When the object leaves the trigger, the objects linked to the button are deactivated. Once you've created a level you can publish it in the workshop. You can also play other players' levels.",

        "description": "This War of Mine: Final Cut contains all the updates and free expansions released so far and introduces not only a new scenario but also expands all scenarios with the locations known from Stories DLCs - even if you don’t own those. In short words - that means you can now experience lots of never-seen-before playthroughs and struggle with new challenges. Main changes: Remastered versions of all the classic locations One new classic scenario and a brand-new character New quests and locations added to the original game Vanilla version of the game ABOUT THIS WAR OF MINE: In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better. This War of Mine - main features: Inspired by real-life events Control your survivors and manage your shelter Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves – anything that helps you survive Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme The universe of This War of Mine has been expanded by following DLCs: The Little Ones - explores the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective - that of a child. This War of Mine: Stories DLCs: Episode 1: The Father's Promise – a heartbreaking tale of loss and hope in a war-torn city Episode 2: The Last Broadcast – where, as a radio operator, you are going to face moral dilemmas and decide, whether there is a price too high for the truth Episode 3: Fading Embers – portrays a story of Anja living in a warzone and carrying a heavy burden as she has to answer to herself what is more important - survival of human legacy or the survival of a man",
